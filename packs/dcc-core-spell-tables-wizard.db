The rune can be traced in any object: on a leaf or tree bark, on a cloak or ring, over a door, under a tabletop, and so on. Subtract -2 from the spell check to trace in mid-air; -4 to trace invisibly; or -8 to trace permanently (does not vanish when triggered). The effect is triggered per the specific sign as described below: when touched, passed, gazed upon, etc. On a failed spell check, the sign fizzles and dissolves and materials are lost. On a success, the spell check becomes the DC for the opposing save. The caster can identify an unknown rune with a successful spell check against the opposing caster&rsquo;s check result.</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Runic Alphabet, Fey]{Runic Alphabet, Fey}</p>","results":[{"_id":"9WwhdMVOr4Jgn7PA","flags":{},"type":0,"text":"Lost, failure, and worse!

This spell can break a pentagram, banish a summoned demon, neutralize a magical potion, or cancel another spell. At its most fundamental level, this spell is a test of wills: the caster attempts to master and break the magical energies already bound together by a rival magic-user. If the caster is stronger, he dispels the enemy magic. If his rival is stronger, the magic stays in place.</p>\n<p>In most cases, concentration aids this spell immensely. A simple dispel magic can be cast in 1 round, and can achieve a maximum spell check result of 21, regardless of die roll, as noted below. For every round of concentration while casting the spell, the spell check can be incrementally higher, as noted on the table</p>\n<p>below. A higher casting time does not guarantee a better result, but spell check results are capped based on the casting time.</p>\n<p>This spell may also be used to counterspell any opposed casting. When used in this manner it can achieve any level of effect regardless of casting time.</p>\n<p>When casting this spell, the effect to be dispelled must have been created with a spell check of equal to or less than the caster&rsquo;s, and the opposing caster receives a Will save. For example, if the caster rolled 16 on the dispel magic spell check, he could cancel an enemy&rsquo;s mirror image that was created with a spell check of 15 or less. If the opposing spell check is not known, the judge should roll it on the spot. The caster does not necessarily know the strength of the magical spell or effect he is attempting to dispel.</p>\n<p>In some cases, as noted below, the opposing caster may prevent a spell from being dispelled by making a Will save against the caster&rsquo;s spell check.

This eldritch hunter is a vile creature of the Abyss with no good intentions. This spell requires a minimum of 1 point of spellburn, and that spellburn will not heal until the eldritch hound returns from whence it came. It has no permanent form on the material plane and usually appears as a shadow or steaming mist. The caster must make known to the hound the object or person it seeks in clear and direct terms; ambiguity may result in the wrong target being sought. A physical sample, such as clothing, hair, or a vial of blood, is preferable; a painting, description, name (or true name) is of secondary value. The hound has an extraordinary sense of smell, as well as rudimentary ESP and second sight. Provided with sufficient foundational evidence and a trail to seek, it is usually very successful in finding its target. It will seek and return the specified person or object, dead or alive, to the place where it was first summoned. It has no preference between &ldquo;dead&rdquo; or &ldquo;alive&rdquo; and usually chooses the most expedient manner. Of course, if the object is on a distant continent or in a dangerous labyrinth, the eldritch hound may be in for a long and potentially unsuccessful journey. A caster who attempts to place terms on the hound &ndash; such as to retrieve an object alive or to make a retrieval only at a certain time or after a certain event, may or may not succeed, as noted in the spell check results below.</p>\n<p>Unless noted otherwise, the hound flies at 100&rsquo;, has ability scores of 14, and can perform any action a normal man could perform. It listens but never speaks. It has AC 18, [[/roll 4d12]] hp, attacks at +8 ([[/roll 2d6]] damage), and saves as the caster. It will not fight arbitrarily or even in the caster&rsquo;s defense &ndash; it will only fight to retrieve the specified person or object, and only then if combat is completely unavoidable. It is patient and would prefer to wait than fight. Provided with sufficient information, there is a base chance the hound succeeds in finding the trail of its target (as noted in the spell checks below), though it cannot shift between planes (unless noted otherwise below), and success in locating the object does not always mean success in retrieving it within the indicated time. The judge may modify this base chance as appropriate.</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Eldritch Hound]{Eldritch Hound}</p>","results":[{"_id":"woUfhYrd8wejEnrr","flags":{},"type":0,"text":"Lost, failure, and worse!

The fey language is composed of eldritch sigils that house subtle but dangerous power. By casting this spell, the caster can trace a fey rune. The materials necessary to inscribe the rune cost 50 gp per rune. The spell check is made to determine which energies the caster can imbue in his rune; the caster can choose one rune at or below the result of the check, with the choice made when the rune is inscribed. The rune can be traced in any object: on a leaf or tree bark, on a cloak or ring, over a door, under a tabletop, and so on. Subtract -2 from the spell check to trace in mid-air; -4 to trace invisibly; or -8 to trace permanently (does not vanish when triggered). The effect is triggered per the specific sign as described below: when touched, passed, gazed upon, etc. On a failed spell check, the sign fizzles and dissolves and materials are lost. On a success, the spell check becomes the DC for the opposing save.

A spell check determines the possible abilities and properties of the weapon to be created. The specifics are determined by the material components, craftsmanship, and other elements incorporated by the caster. This spell is cast as an ongoing ritual through the weapon-forging process, and the caster may need a partner to forge the weapon if he is not a blacksmith himself. Spellburn utilized in the casting is lost for the duration of the casting and only heals when the spell is complete. All costs are expended before the spell check is made, and failure means all costs are lost; a weapon that is unsuccessfully enchanted can be re-forged to recover half the material costs involved. Generally speaking, follow this process to create a magic weapon:</p>\n<p><strong>Forge the weapon:</strong> The weapon must be forged while this spell is cast. A dagger, short sword, long sword, or two-handed sword is easily enchanted. Using this spell to enchant other kinds of weapons entails a -1 penalty to the spell check, increased to -2 if the caster is not proficient with the weapon in question. Construction of the physical weapon itself costs a minimum of 100x the cost of a normal weapon of that type in raw materials of the highest quality, plus any wages paid to the blacksmith(s).</p>\n<p><strong>The basic enchantment:</strong> The spell check determines the basic enchantment. The caster&rsquo;s level determines the maximum possible effectiveness of the weapon: CL5 = +1, CL6 = +2, CL7 = +3, CL8 = +4, CL10 = +5. Make the spell check and compare the result to Table 8-4 to determine the &ldquo;plus&rdquo; of the weapon. The cost of a plus, in addition to the weapon itself, is as follows, reflected in extraordinarily rare materials: +1 = 5,000 gp; +2 = 10,000 gp; +3 = 50,000 gp; +4 = 500,000 gp; +5 = 1,000,000 gp.</p>\n<p><strong>The weapon&rsquo;s intelligence:</strong> A magic weapon is always intelligent. The single spell check determines the basic enchantment, the weapon&rsquo;s intelligence, and all other aspects of the magic sword. Reference Table 8-4 to determine the dice rolled for the weapon&rsquo;s Intelligence and how it communicates. The weapon has a personality that is a blend of the caster&rsquo;s, the blacksmith involved, patrons invoked, and any other particulars of its creation (a dragon-bane weapon may be arrogant like a dragon).</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> A magic weapon is usually, but not always, the same alignment as its creator. Reference Table 8-3 for the result of the spell check. Weapons of different alignments than their creators will not be easy to use.</p>\n<p><strong>Banes:</strong> A magic weapon can be constructed for the purpose of slaying a particular kind of foe. Reference Table 8-4 to determine the number of potential banes at any given spell check result and Table 8-5 for the effects of various banes. Each bane built into a weapon costs from 20,000 to 100,000 gp and requires voluminous material samples of the creature type in question (for example, a dozen dragon corpses or 100 orcs). The cost depends on the level of effect and is at the discretion of the judge (i.e., the most deadly result of instant death costs the most, while the simplest result of a bonus to hit is the cheapest). The caster must declare what kind of banes he is trying to instill in his weapon. Depending on the spell check, he may be successful in none, some, or all of those. If a limited number is granted, the judge randomly determines which are successful.</p>\n<p><strong>Special purpose:</strong> A magic weapon always has a special purpose, and it is not always under the control of the caster. The special purpose is determined by the most recondite of factors, ranging from astrological signs to natural terrain to the most subtle properties used in the crafting of the weapon. Table 8-4 indicates the dice rolled for a weapon&rsquo;s special purpose, based on the spell check; those dice are then rolled on table 8-6. The result is always random, then the caster can utilize spellburn to shift the table&rsquo;s results. For every point of spellburn, he can increase or decrease his roll by 1 point. This spellburn is determined after rolling for the special purpose. The level of spellburn employed determines the caster&rsquo;s knowledge of the process and how carefully he can actually influence the result of his crafting. Under certain circumstances, particularly if a caster has a powerful patron, the judge may choose a special purpose that is aligned with the caster&rsquo;s patron or some other greater power. There is no gp cost to a special purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Powers:</strong> Sword powers come in three varieties: type I, type II, and type III (see tables 8-7, 8-8, and 8-9). The special check determines which powers a sword may have. The caster pays a cost to imbue a sword with powers: 10,000 gp for each type I power, 20,000 gp for each type II power, and 50,000 for each type III power. Depending on the result of the spell check, the weapon will have some number of those powers evident at the completion of the casting. It is quite possible that the caster will spend the money to imbue the powers but his spell check will not be sufficient to complete them, or his spell check results in a percentile chance which does not yield those powers.</p>\n<p><strong>Creation properties:</strong> Several of the entries above note specialized circumstances that can influence a sword&rsquo;s final traits. These creation properties are sometimes known factors, and other times are incidental events that affect the creation process inadvertently. Here are some potential creation properties, which can be used by the player to attempt to influence the final weapon created and by the judge to introduce unusual purposes or powers beyond the intent of the creator. Creation properties: crafter (not necessarily caster) is an elf, dwarf, giant, god, demon, last of a line, a wronged king, or seventh son; weapon is crafted on the plane of fire (or in a volcano or lava lake), on the plane of water (or under the sea, deep in a lake, or on a sailing ship), on the plane of earth (or far below in the underdeep, or within a mine), on the plane of air (or on a cloud, or atop a mountain above the clouds), on the plane of a demon prince or one of the Nine Hells, in the lair of a great dragon, in a graveyard or ossuary, a lich&rsquo;s crypt, a vampire&rsquo;s coffin, or a mummy&rsquo;s tomb, on a great battlefield, or in the fey lands; date of crafting is the birthday of a prince, the day a witch is hanged, or on the death of a god; moment of completion is at sunset, sunrise, high noon, during a full moon, during an eclipse; material components of sword include remnants of a pegasus, dragon, demon, un-dead, etc.; creator&rsquo;s Luck is at a certain level; iron or wood from which sword is forged is from a specific place; creator&rsquo;s spoken language includes a certain tongue; and so on.</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Sword Magic]{Sword Magic}</p>","results":[{"_id":"rjBTI6vhrA15UEFx","flags":{},"type":0,"text":"Lost and corruption.","img":"icons/svg/d20-black.svg","resultId":"","weight":1,"range":[-99,1],"drawn":false},{"_id":"Gm2P5pxlCWxt3Mzf","flags":{},"type":0,"text":"Lost.

The</p>\n<p>initial ceremony takes one week to complete. Once the pact is made, the caster may invoke the patron&rsquo;s support with the spell invoke patron, and it may or may not answer as it sees fit. In return for the patron&rsquo;s assistance, it may ask the caster to do certain things. The caster must act faithfully in its service at all times, lest it cast him off. The caster may perform more than one ceremony to serve multiple masters, but doing so may raise questions as to his true loyalties.

Very powerful creatures are more likely to successfully bond with patrons (who look more favorably upon powerful followers). Typically, a casting of patron bond on behalf of another receives a bonus of +2 if the subject is of 5th-level (5 HD) or higher and +4 if the subject is of 9th-level (9 HD) or higher.

They may be necromancers who study the lore of un-dead or pyromancers who control fire. They may be elementalists who can control free-willed elementals or summoners who bring material objects into existence from nowhere. These specialist mages go beyond the capabilities of normal magic-users by studying, pondering, and ultimately completely connecting to the school of arcane magic they choose. A necromancer may live with un-dead</p>\n<p>creatures to fully understand them. A pyromancer may dwell in a volcano. An elementalist may live on one of the four elemental planes, and a conjurer may study the atomic building blocks of matter.</p>\n<p>This spell is the mechanism by which specialty magic happens. This spell forms an affinity between the caster and one kind of magic. This affinity comes after much time and labor is expended and has a cost:</p>\n<p>the spell slot is forever occupied by this very spell, and the caster is forever connected to the arcane element he chooses. However, this spell also has a benefit: it makes the caster more powerful in a specific school of magic.</p>\n<p>Although this spell is listed in the caster&rsquo;s spellbook as the spell arcane affinity, it is really a different spell depending on each caster&rsquo;s goal. It truly represents the time and effort necessary to develop an affinity for a particular school of magic. The &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; is a set of rituals and actions necessary to form the affinity. This is a level 2 spell because a caster must understand the basic principles of magic before he can build an affinity. Traditional affinities and their &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; are as follows. Note the &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; can, in game terms, be considered to overlap with adventuring time or be a lull between adventures.</p>\n<p>&bull; Illusionist: A specialist in spells that alter perceptions or create false images and sounds. An illusionist must spend at least one year understanding how the human body processes sensory input and how it can be fooled.</p>\n<p>&bull; Summoner: A specialist in spells that summon animals, monsters, and other creatures to aid the caster, including elementals and demons. A summoner may further specialize in a particular kind of creatures summoned (e.g., elementals). Summoners may also specialize in summoning objects as well as creatures. A summoner must spend at least one year studying the creatures he wants to summon, both in captivity and in their natural surroundings.</p>\n<p>&bull; Necromancer: A specialist in the un-dead, their creation, their control, and their limits. A necromancer may ultimately pursue eternal life via his own transformation into an un-dead. A necromancer must spend at least one year in the presence of un-dead.</p>\n<p>&bull; Transmuter: A specialist in changing matter from one form to another, whether it be flesh to stone, iron to gold, or something in between. A transmuter must spend at least one year in a laboratory studying the properties of different materials.</p>\n<p>&bull; Pyromancer: A specialist in the study of fire. Pyromancers must spend at least one year in the presence of great flames, such as an active volcano or on the plane of fire. Pyromancers ultimately learn to create, control, and destroy flames at will. There are other specialists who study similar magical powers but control other elements; e.g., fulminators who study electricity, cryomancers who study cold, and aerialists who study air.</p>\n<p>&bull; Demonologist: A specialist in the summoning, control, exorcism, destruction, and lore of demons. This is a dangerous specialty, for demons are never willing to divulge the information necessary to control them. A demonologist must spend at least three years studying ancient tomes, consulting supernatural spirits, and traveling to distant planes to learn what he needs to control demons.</p>\n<p>After a specialist has committed the necessary &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; to specialize in one field, a spell check is made. The spell check determines the benefit of specialization, as noted below. Many specialists utilize spellburn at this point to ensure a good result.

This patron may be a demon, devil, ghost, spirit, elemental, angel, chaos lord, or other supernatural being who accepts the caster&rsquo;s service. The</p>\n<p>initial ceremony takes one week to complete. Once the pact is made, the caster may invoke the patron&rsquo;s support with the spell invoke patron, and it may or may not answer as it sees fit. In return for the patron&rsquo;s assistance, it may ask the caster to do certain things. The caster must act faithfully in its service at all times, lest it cast him off. The caster may perform more than one ceremony to serve multiple masters, but doing so may raise questions as to his true loyalties. This is dangerous magic; a supernatural patron is not the same as the deity that a cleric may worship. The caster should be forewarned that he is in communion with almighty spirits.</p>\n<p>Alternately, once the caster has formed a bond with his patron, this spell may be cast to create a bond between another mortal and the caster&rsquo;s patron. The mortal need not be a spellcaster; in fact, the second mortal usually is not. In this case, both the caster and the recipient must spend a week on the ceremony, which requires a mighty oath to declare allegiance to the patron. Very powerful creatures are more likely to successfully bond with patrons (who look more favorably upon powerful followers). Typically, a casting of patron bond on behalf of another receives a bonus of +2 if the subject is of 5th-level (5 HD) or higher and +4 if the subject is of 9th-level (9 HD) or higher. At the end of the ceremony, the casting of the spell seals the bond.

If a casting succeeds, the staff's wielder receives a +1 bonus to spell checks when casting those spells or a +2 bonus if the original caster level is 4 or higher. The staff also grants a +1 bonus to saving throws and armor class or a +2 bonus if the original caster level is 4 or higher. Additionally, the caster can imbue the staff with fixed charges associated with the three spells he casts. For the first spell, he makes a spell check. If it succeeds, he makes another spell check for the same spell, a number of times up to his caster level. For example, a level 4 caster could make up to 4 checks if each succeeds. <br /><br />Then he repeats this process for the second and third spells. For each check that succeeds, he imbues the staff with 1 charge of the relevant spell. For example, the level 4 caster could put up to 12 charges in the staff if every check succeeded (3 spells x 4 castings per spell = 12 charges). Thenceforth, the caster may burn those charges to cast the three spells stored in the staff, making a normal spell check to cast the spell, modified by the +1 or +2 bonus associated with that spell. Once expended, the charges are lost unless renewed. Renewal requires a modified casting of this spell, with a casting time of 1 week and no materials or spellburn required; if this modified version succeeds at DC 30 or better, the caster can repeat the process above to restore the castings, but cannot exceed the original number of charges. <br /><br />For example: a level 4 caster attempts to burn the spells sleep, spider web, and strength into his staff. The minimum successful check result for sleep (a level 1 spell) is DC 12. His check results are 14, 16, 12, and 9. The first three checks succeed, so he imbues three charges into his staff. For spider web (a level 2 spell with minimum check result of DC 14), his first check is a 19 but his second check is a 12. He manages to imbue only one charge into the staff. Finally, he casts strength (minimum check result of DC 14) and rolls 20, 19, 17, and 18  four successes! <br /><br />The final tally is a staff with 8 charges: 3x sleep, 1x spider web, and 4x strength. Because he was CL 4 when casting, each of these spells is cast with a +2 bonus.","img":"icons/svg/d20-black.svg","resultId":"","weight":2,"range":[32,33],"drawn":false},{"_id":"t8wnlznTSBLlUQOI","flags":{},"type":0,"text":"The caster succeeds in crafting a simple staff, which is linked to his soul.

They should be determined with the aid of the judge.","img":"icons/svg/d20-black.svg","resultId":"","weight":66,"range":[34,99],"drawn":false}],"formula":"1d20","replacement":true,"displayRoll":true}

This patron may be a demon, devil, ghost, spirit, elemental, angel, chaos lord, or other supernatural being who accepts the caster&rsquo;s service. The</p>\n<p>initial ceremony takes one week to complete. Once the pact is made, the caster may invoke the patron&rsquo;s support with the spell invoke patron, and it may or may not answer as it sees fit. In return for the patron&rsquo;s assistance, it may ask the caster to do certain things. The caster must act faithfully in its service at all times, lest it cast him off. The caster may perform more than one ceremony to serve multiple masters, but doing so may raise questions as to his true loyalties. This is dangerous magic; a supernatural patron is not the same as the deity that a cleric may worship. The caster should be forewarned that he is in communion with almighty spirits.</p>\n<p>Alternately, once the caster has formed a bond with his patron, this spell may be cast to create a bond between another mortal and the caster&rsquo;s patron. The mortal need not be a spellcaster; in fact, the second mortal usually is not. In this case, both the caster and the recipient must spend a week on the ceremony, which requires a mighty oath to declare allegiance to the patron. Very powerful creatures are more likely to successfully bond with patrons (who look more favorably upon powerful followers). Typically, a casting of patron bond on behalf of another receives a bonus of +2 if the subject is of 5th-level (5 HD) or higher and +4 if the subject is of 9th-level (9 HD) or higher. At the end of the ceremony, the casting of the spell seals the bond.
