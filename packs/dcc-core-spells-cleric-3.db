Typically, an item belonging to the target, or a piece of the target&rsquo;s physical body (hair, blood, fingernail,</p>\n<p>etc.) is required to cast this spell. Attempting the spell without such an item imposes a -4 penalty to the spell check. Additionally, casting the spell without a physical link to the target reduces the range of the spell to 100&rsquo; per CL.</p>\n<p>When cast, the cleric makes a spell check as normal. If his spell check exceeds the spell check made when the original patron bond was cast, the bond is broken and the subject of the bond loses all benefits of that bond immediately. This can include losing patron spells he has previously learned. The subject cannot attempt to reform the patron bond until one month has past or some powerful magic has offset the exorcism.</p>\n<p>In addition, the subject may suffer side effects from the breaking of the bond (see below).</p>\n<p>If the cleric&rsquo;s spell check is insufficient to break the patron bond, it is likely that the powers involved attempt to punish the cleric for his meddling.

This spell works only on intelligent creatures and magical constructions that were named by their creator. Un-dead, slimes, animals, and similar creatures that do not possess names are immune to this spell. Other creatures may or may not be affected at the judge&rsquo;s discretion. A successful Will save indicates that the target&rsquo;s true name remains hidden from the cleric.</p>\n<p>In order to gain the knowledge of a creature&rsquo;s true name (or one of them; many creatures possess a number of secret names of varying power), the cleric must either be within range and have a clear view of the target or possess a personal item or physical component (blood, hair, fingernails, etc.) of the target. If the cleric has a portion of the target&rsquo;s physical body, this spell can be cast at any distance provided that the target is on the same plane of existence as the cleric.</p>\n<p>Once a creature&rsquo;s true name is known, the cleric permanently enjoys the benefits indicated by the spell check below. He can attempt to recast the spell to further deduce the target&rsquo;s secret name(s), but a failure on subsequent castings of the spell makes the target permanently immune to further attempts by the cleric &ndash; he has learned all he can about his target. Due to the complexities and magical nature of true names, the cleric cannot easily share a true name with another person. Attempts to write or speak the true name become garbled in the communication process and the would-be recipient of the name must</p>\n<p>make a spell check with a result equal to or greater than that of the cleric&rsquo;s spell check to comprehend the priest&rsquo;s attempt to share the true name. Failure means it is impossible for the recipient to understand the cleric and he cannot make another attempt to comprehend the true name unless the cleric recasts the spell.</p>\n<p>An individual whose true name has fallen into the possession of another can attempt to nullify that name and negate all&nbsp; bonuses granted to the possessor of the name.
