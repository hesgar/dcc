Typically this restores lost ability scores or broken/severed limbs, though it can also heal. This spell cannot restore lost Luck. The spell can be cast on the cleric or an ally.</p>\n<p>In playtests, some groups attempted to combine this spell with a wizard&rsquo;s spellburn to create a &ldquo;one-two combo&rdquo; &ndash; the wizard would burn points for spellburn, the cleric would immediately restore those points, then the wizard would burn those points again. Although legal within the letter of the rules, it is important that the judge recall that DCC RPG is a game where magic is not an act of chemistry; it is an invocation of the wills of supernatural creatures. Cleric magic is the act of divine creatures, and wizard magic is frequently the result of deals, agreements, and arrangements with demons, devils, ghosts, and supernatural patrons. Using restore vitality to offset spellburn will inevitably create trouble for the cleric, whose deity surely does not appreciate his power being used to heal wounds deliberately created to further the ends of another supernatural creature!</p><br><p><strong>Manifestation:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Restore Vitality Manifestation]{Restore Vitality Manifestation}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d3]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Manifestation</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">the target is cured with no visible effect</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">the target is cured and the mark of the cleric’s deity appears as birthmark or small scar in a place that was previously affected by the ability loss</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a shaft of heavenly light shines on the target, bathing him in light as his ability scores are restored.</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Results:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-cleric.Restore Vitality]{Restore Vitality}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d20]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Spell Result</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1 - 13</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Failure.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">14 - 15</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The cleric restores ability score drain that is non-permanent in nature.

For example, if temporarily blinded, it has its sight restored; if deafened, it can now hear; if lamed, it can now walk. Lost limbs do re-grow, and defects caused by physical means (e.g. blindness caused by the plucking of eyeballs from the skull) are corrected, even if the missing body parts are not at hand. In addition, the creature permanently gains +1 hit point to its maximum total. This benefit may be received multiple times, but for each hit point permanently gifted to a single target after the first, the cleric permanently loses 1 hit point.</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>","img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/stump-regrowth.svg","_id":"0G8uiRHfHT5DBiR3"}

This patron may be a demon, devil, ghost, spirit, elemental, angel, chaos lord, or other supernatural being who accepts the caster&rsquo;s service. The</p>\n<p>initial ceremony takes one week to complete. Once the pact is made, the caster may invoke the patron&rsquo;s support with the spell invoke patron, and it may or may not answer as it sees fit. In return for the patron&rsquo;s assistance, it may ask the caster to do certain things. The caster must act faithfully in its service at all times, lest it cast him off. The caster may perform more than one ceremony to serve multiple masters, but doing so may raise questions as to his true loyalties. This is dangerous magic; a supernatural patron is not the same as the deity that a cleric may worship. The caster should be forewarned that he is in communion with almighty spirits.</p>\n<p>Alternately, once the caster has formed a bond with his patron, this spell may be cast to create a bond between another mortal and the caster&rsquo;s patron. The mortal need not be a spellcaster; in fact, the second mortal usually is not. In this case, both the caster and the recipient must spend a week on the ceremony, which requires a mighty oath to declare allegiance to the patron. Very powerful creatures are more likely to successfully bond with patrons (who look more favorably upon powerful followers). Typically, a casting of patron bond on behalf of another receives a bonus of +2 if the subject is of 5th-level (5 HD) or higher and +4 if the subject is of 9th-level (9 HD) or higher. At the end of the ceremony, the casting of the spell seals the bond. Recruiting additional followers for his patron brings the caster favor and may grant boons to the other followers; though, their patron will ask fealty of them in exchange.</p>\n<p>Note that continued casting of this spell may taint the caster, both spiritually and physically.</p><br><p><strong>Results:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-wizard.Patron Bond (Other)]{Patron Bond (Other)}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d20]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Spell Result</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Lost and patron taint!

This spell can break a pentagram, banish a summoned demon, neutralize a magical potion, or cancel another spell. At its most fundamental level, this spell is a test of wills: the caster attempts to master and break the magical energies already bound together by a rival magic-user. If the caster is stronger, he dispels the enemy magic. If his rival is stronger, the magic stays in place.</p>\n<p>In most cases, concentration aids this spell immensely. A simple dispel magic can be cast in 1 round, and can achieve a maximum spell check result of 21, regardless of die roll, as noted below. For every round of concentration while casting the spell, the spell check can be incrementally higher, as noted on the table</p>\n<p>below. A higher casting time does not guarantee a better result, but spell check results are capped based on the casting time.</p>\n<p>This spell may also be used to counterspell any opposed casting. When used in this manner it can achieve any level of effect regardless of casting time.</p>\n<p>When casting this spell, the effect to be dispelled must have been created with a spell check of equal to or less than the caster&rsquo;s, and the opposing caster receives a Will save. For example, if the caster rolled 16 on the dispel magic spell check, he could cancel an enemy&rsquo;s mirror image that was created with a spell check of 15 or less. If the opposing spell check is not known, the judge should roll it on the spot. The caster does not necessarily know the strength of the magical spell or effect he is attempting to dispel.</p>\n<p>In some cases, as noted below, the opposing caster may prevent a spell from being dispelled by making a Will save against the caster&rsquo;s spell check. For example, the owner of the mirror image spell could attempt to maintain its functioning by making a Will save of greater than or equal to the caster&rsquo;s spell check result.</p><br><p><strong>Misfire:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Dispel Magic Misfire]{Dispel Magic Misfire}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d4]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Misfire</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a randomly determined magic item on the caster's person [if any] is partially disenchanted, permanently losing one \"plus\" or special ability;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">instead of targeting what the caster intended, the dispel effect targets one randomly determined spell effect within 50', which is automatically suppressed for [[/roll 1d6]] rounds;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">the spell enhances magical effects instead of dispelling them, such that all spell checks made within 20' of the caster [including the caster's] receive a +1 bonus for the next [[/roll 1d6]] rounds;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">the spell releases the energy of the last spell the caster dispelled and casts it at a spell check result of [[/roll 1d10+14]]; for example, if the last spell dispelled was a choking cloud, then a new choking cloud suddenly appears; if the judge and player cannot remember the last spell dispelled, determine one randomly of level [[/roll 1d4]] on Table X-X: Wizard spells.

In combination with other spells used in the casting ritual, the animated creature may speak (e.g., magic mouth), fly (e.g., fly), or have other properties (e.g., invisibility, fire resistance, etc.).

If the proper shell is built for the caster's creation, he can use this spell to create golems, living statues, homunculi, and other such things. The caster can construct a golem-like body, per the notes below, as a receptacle for the spell. Construction time is a minimum of 1 month. The target of the casting can weigh up to 10,000 lbs. and be up to four times man-sized. To attempt the creation of permanent life, the caster must cast a ritualized version of this spell requiring one week's time and a minimum of 10 points of spellburn; otherwise, a lesser casting of this spell is treated as result 32-33 above. The caster has complete control over the creature. It never questions the caster's directives, even if asked to complete seemingly impossible or suicidal tasks. DCC RPG does not include complete statistics for golems and other such creatures, as the author prefers to leave the pursuit of such things up to the reader's creativity. As general guidelines, the creation of a man-sized golem-like shell for this spell can proceed with stats as follows. Larger or smaller golems can also be created, of course. The shells below do not include special properties; they are simply receptacles. See result 36+ below for more on special properties. A shell costs 10,000 gold pieces to create plus additional costs as noted below. Sufficient raw materials are obviously required.

The spirit may be the ghost of a deceased person, a demon residing on another plane, a nature spirit occupying a lake or tree, the caster&rsquo;s own supernatural patron, or even a god.</p>\n<p>This spell is most effective if the caster consults with a spirit he already knows. If the caster consults with his patron (per the patron bond spell) or one of the patron&rsquo;s servants, add +1 to the spell check. If the caster consults with another specific spirit known to him from prior contact, legend, logical deduction (e.g., the caster sees a dead body and wishes to find its ghost), or research (e.g., the caster has visited his altar or read of his exploits), there is no modifier. If the caster has no knowledge of the spirit consulted, merely wishes to contact any spirit that will answer, or deliberately contacts a spirit of opposed alignment or interests, subtract -1 from the spell check.</p>\n<p>If the spirit is known to the caster, roll d% to determine its attitude: (01-20) friendly, (21-80) neutral, (81-00) hostile. A friendly or neutral spirit answers honestly to the best of its ability and has a base 50% chance of knowing the answer to any given question appropriate to its area of knowledge, modified by the judge&rsquo;s discretion and the obscurity of the question. When questioning a hostile spirit, roll d%: it (01-50) provides misleading information; (51-80) refuses to answer; (81-95) attempts to probe the caster&rsquo;s mind (Will save vs. DC of [[/roll 4d6]] or take [[/roll 1d4]] temporary Int damage); or (96-100) uses this connection to attempt enter the material plane.</p>\n<p>Note that establishing contact in this manner also enables the spirit to establish reverse contact on future occasions (by casting this same spell, if it is able, or other similar abilities). Furthermore, not all spirits are pleased at an interruption from a curious mortal. The ghost of a recently slain creature, for example, is probably quite angry at its death, and there may be consequences for awakening it.</p><br><p><strong>Manifestation:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Consult Spirit Manifestation]{Consult Spirit Manifestation}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d3]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Manifestation</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster freezes and appears to do nothing for duration</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster flickers in and out of existence as questioning occurs</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster carries on one side of a conversation</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Misfire:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Consult Spirit Misfire]{Consult Spirit Misfire}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d3]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Misfire</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster successfully contacts his own spirit, where it resides beyond life and death awaiting his mortal conclusion, which gives way to a bizarre sense of dj vu and disorientation that causes a -1 penalty to all actions for 1 turn;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster contacts a spirit that immediately takes over his body, causing him to fall under the judge's control for [[/roll 1d6]] rounds and act in a manner opposite of his normal tendencies and alignment;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster forces his own spirit out of his body for [[/roll 1d6]] rounds, causing him to collapse into a catatonic state until his spirit returns</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Consult Spirit Corruption]{Consult Spirit Corruption}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d6]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Corruption</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster's face takes on the appearance of a randomly determined spirit;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster's consciousness is permanently linked to that of a randomly determined spirit, which has a 1% chance each day of taking possession of the caster's body for a duration of [[/roll 1d4]] rounds during that day;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster's hair turns white and stands on end;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster instantly ages [[/roll 1d8+2]] years;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">5</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster's skin wrinkles as if he were 100 years old, but he does not actually age and has no other signs or consequences of aging;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">6</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster's ears become sensitive to the noises of ghosts, and he can hear whenever spirits are near, even if no contact is made</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Results:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-wizard.Consult Spirit]{Consult Spirit}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d20]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Spell Result</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Lost, failure, and worse!

While the spirit cannot control the caster's mortal form, its personality may occasionally break through in the caster's pattern of speech or body language. <br /><br />Great and powerful spirits may have profound knowledge beyond the caster's understanding (i.e., the memories of a god or the long-range intrigues of a demon prince), but to the extent that the caster's intelligence and mortal mind can understand the thoughts of the spirit in question, he can form an almost perfect link. The caster's questions are quickly and accurately answered by the spirit, and the caster can surrender his free will to allow the spirit's mind to guide his actions. <br /><br />Generally speaking, this is sufficient to confer a +4 bonus to activities based on the spirit's knowledge and expertise. For example, if the caster contacts the creator of a spell, then surrenders his free will to cast the spell, he would receive a +4 bonus to that spell check; or, if the caster contacts his patron and casts a patron spell, he would receive a +4 bonus to the spell check.

A blizzard blankets the area; hailstones fall from the sky; gale-force winds tear at rooftops; thunderstorms throw lighting down; tornadoes begin to touch down; etc. These destructive conditions are powerful enough to cause environmental damage to creatures caught outside (typically 1 to [[/roll 1d4]] points per round of exposure).<br /><br /> The weather change is dependent on the season and the cleric has no control over the direction the weather takes.

Up to three weather effects of his choosing occur simultaneously, provided they do not conflict with one another. The cleric can have gale force winds, freezing sleet, and lightning happen in the same storm; summon down tornadoes, bludgeoning hail, and blinding rain all at once; ravage coasts with water spouts, tsunamis, and impenetrable fog; or any other combination of his choosing. <br /><br />The cleric could not, however, have scorching heat and freezing snow happen together.

This sanctum becomes a refuge for the cleric and other worshippers of the deity. The spell can also be cast upon a space already sacrosanct to another deity. If the cleric&rsquo;s spell check is greater than that of the cleric who originally sanctified the space, the area becomes desecrated and no longer grants any benefits to those within. A space that has been desecrated must be cleansed of any lingering traces of its former divine connection (a month-long process) before it can be sanctified to a new deity. No cleansing is necessary to re-sanctify a space to its former divine protector.</p>\n<p>The cleric, worshippers of the cleric&rsquo;s deity, and those of the same alignment of the cleric gain the full benefit of the sanctuary as determined by the spell check. Those of a different alignment who worship a deity not in direct opposition to the cleric&rsquo;s deity gain half the normal benefits of the sanctuary (rounded up), i.e. a cleric of a different, but not antagonistic, god would receive a +1 bonus to laying on hands if the cleric who cast the sanctify/desecrate spell scored a 20 on her spell check.

In addition, the sanctuary provides a bonus to actions related to the deity to which it is dedicated.

For example, a sanctuary dedicated to Klazath, god of war, would modify all combat rolls made by the cleric and his followers while within the sacred space. The devotees of Amun Tor, god of mysteries and riddles, would gain the sanctuary&rsquo;s bonus to rolls made to decipher codes or uncover hidden clues; while those of Bobugbubilz, demon lord of evil amphibians, would discover that all batrachian servants or summoned creatures within the sanctuary add the bonus to their hit points, saving throws, and attack rolls.</p><br><p><strong>Manifestation:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Sanctify/Desecrate Manifestation]{Sanctify/Desecrate Manifestation}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d4]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Manifestation</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">the affected area erupts in harmless, divine fire that leaves the sanctum magically cleansed</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">the affected area glows with a divine radiance of a color appropriate to the cleric’s deity</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a blast of celestial music spills from the cleric’s mouth, causing the affected area to resonate with the music of the spheres</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">tears of holy/unholy water flow from the cleric’s eyes, anointing the affected area</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Results:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-cleric.Sanctify/Desecrate]{Sanctify/Desecrate}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d20]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Spell Result</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1 - 17</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Failure.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">18 - 19</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The cleric creates a minor sanctuary.

Their anathemas are fell magics and the chaos-born corruption these magics unleash; supplicants of the Three Fates must exercise great discipline lest they become the monsters they seek to vanquish. Those that align themselves with the Three Fates tend to one of two archetypes: either the wizened arch-paladin, marshaling white magic against the forces of chaos, or the fiercely paranoid witch-hunter, seeking&mdash;and often finding&mdash; corruption behind the illusive masks of the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note: These spell check results reference the judge rolling a randomly chosen die to determine when bonuses take effect.

The fey language is composed of eldritch sigils that house subtle but dangerous power. By casting this spell, the caster can trace a fey rune.</p>\n<p>The materials necessary to inscribe the rune cost 200 gp per rune. The spell check is made to determine which energies the caster can imbue in his rune; the caster can choose one rune at or below the result of the check, with the choice made when the rune is inscribed. The rune can be traced in any object: on a leaf or tree bark, on a cloak or ring, over a door, under a tabletop, and so on. Subtract -2 from the spell check to trace in mid-air; -4 to trace invisibly; or -8 to trace permanently (does not vanish when triggered). The effect is triggered per the specific sign as described below: when touched, passed, gazed upon, etc. On a failed spell check, the sign fizzles and dissolves and materials are lost. On a success, the spell check becomes the DC for the opposing save.

The first creature to disturb the rune feels a sharp pang of intense pain. The target takes [[/roll 2d6]] damage immediately and sprouts a bloody wound, as if it had been stabbed. The rune dissolves once triggered.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">18 - 21</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Burn. The first creature to disturb the rune suffers a painful burning sensation. This causes [[/roll 1d6+1]] hit points of damage immediately, then [[/roll 1d6]] points one hour later, then [[/roll 1d6]]-1 points an hour after that, then [[/roll 1d6]]-2 and [[/roll 1d6]]-3 points at the next two hour intervals. The rune dissolves once triggered.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">22 - 23</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Rebuff. A creature attempting to pass through the place protected by the rune feels a strong hand pushing it back. The target must make a Will save against the spell check. Failure indicates it is rebuffed and cannot pass and takes [[/roll 1d4]] points of damage. The target may continue to attempt to pass each round until it succeeds but continues to take damage on any failed save. The rune remains intact until it is passed.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">24 - 26</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Explosive. When triggered, the rune explodes in a fiery burst. All within 10' take [[/roll 3d6]] damage and flammable objects catch fire.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">27 - 31</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Safety. The object on which this rune is inscribed is protected. Creatures attempting to attack it must make a Will save. Failure indicates they lose the urge to attack, forget about the target, somehow miss wildly, or otherwise cannot succeed in an attack. Additionally, on a failed save the attacker immediately falls asleep for [[/roll 1d4]] rounds. Creatures that fail the save may attempt to attack on a subsequent round. The rune continues to protect its target until it is breached.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">32 - 33</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Repulse. Any attempt to pass through this rune triggers a powerful force that sends the target flying back [[/roll 3d20]] feet. The force of the repulsion is such that the creature takes [[/roll 1d8]] damage from the repulsion. This rune is often placed near ledges or pits so the repulsion sends the victim into a dangerous place.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">34 - 35</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Lightning rod. The first creature to disturb this rune observes the rune crackle and dissipate, but that is all. The target is now designated as a lightning rod. The next time the creature is in stormy weather of any kind, it automatically attracts [[/roll 1d4]] lightning bolts per minute, each doing [[/roll 3d6]] damage. If the creature is hit by a lightning bolt spell (or similar effect), it takes an additional [[/roll 2d6]] damage. The effect wears off after 7 days.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">36+</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Rage. The first creature to disturb this rune is enveloped in an overwhelming rage. It must make a Will save or attack the nearest living creature (ally or not). It fights to the death.

The spell is easiest if the creature has already been summoned for control via another spell.

The cleric binds that creature to obey his will instead of the will of its current master. A Will save is allowed to resist, but the Will save is made by the other spellcaster not the target creature, which is already dominated. If the check is successful, control of the bound creature transfers to the cleric casting binding. The cleric retains control for a time, after which control reverts back to the original caster (by which time the original summoning or controlling spell may have ended).

These hit points are lost first when he is wounded, and damage suffered while giant-sized transfers to his normal hit point pool only if he first loses all 100 bonus hit points. The duration of this extraordinary display of power depends on the size of the target: a target transformed to a 100' height stays at that size for only 1 turn, while sizes of progressively smaller 10' increments last 1 turn longer. <br /><br />For every 20' less in size, the benefit to attacks, damage, and AC drops by -1, and the bonus hit points drop by -10, but the duration is extended by 1 turn.

All spells cast directly at the wizard suffer a -2 penalty to their spell checks. Area-of-effect spells or other magics that are not targeted directly at the mask wearer are unmodified.

The targeted creature must be able to see the caster clearly to be affected by the gaze. <br /><br />The caster can attempt to affect one creature each round for the duration of the spell and can try to instill fear on the same creature more than once, requiring it to make a new saving throw with each attempt. The caster’s face becomes monstrously demonic while this mask is in effect.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">24 - 27</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The mask protects the caster against physical attacks, granting him a +4 bonus to AC while the spell is in effect.

The caster’s face appears encased in shining steel while this mask is in effect.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">28 - 29</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The mask reflects melee and ranged attacks back at unlucky assailants. Any attacker that successfully strikes the mask’s wearer with a physical melee or missile attack must make a Luck check or find their attack turned against them. <br /><br />The attacker’s same attack roll (including any and all modifiers) is applied to its own AC and inflicts normal damage if the blow lands successfully. The caster’s face appears to be that of his attacker(s) while the mask is in effect.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">30 - 31</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The mask transforms the caster’s entire head into that of a snake. While in effect, the mask grants the caster both the illusion generating and hypnotic gaze powers of a serpent-man (see page 425). As an incidental benefit, it also allows the caster to pass himself off as a serpent-man under cursory inspection. The mask’s effect on the caster’s face is self-evident.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">32+</td>\n<td align=\"left\">With this powerful casting, the wizard’s face is occluded by a mask that combines all the spell’s possible effects into a single visage. The caster has infravision up to 60’; gains a +4 saving throw bonus against gaze attacks; harmful spells cast directly at the caster suffer a -2 penalty to spell checks; the caster can instill fear against any creature that fails a Will save, forcing it to flee for [[/roll 1d4]]+CL rounds; the caster’s AC is improved by +4, and all saves receive a +2 bonus (this stacks with the +4 bonus against gaze attacks); any attacker who successfully strikes the caster with a physical melee or missile attack must make a Luck check or possibly be struck by its own attack (compare the initial attack roll against its own AC); and the caster’s face is transformed into a serpent’s head, granting him the illusionary and hypnotic capabilities of a serpent-man (see page 425). <br /><br />At this level of success, the mask makes no alterations to the caster’s face other than the snake’s head transformation (which can be obscured with the illusion generation ability granted by that alteration).</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>","img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/ceremonial-mask.svg","_id":"L4nEb8sbuCzbpDti"}

This spell works only on intelligent creatures and magical constructions that were named by their creator. Un-dead, slimes, animals, and similar creatures that do not possess names are immune to this spell. Other creatures may or may not be affected at the judge&rsquo;s discretion. A successful Will save indicates that the target&rsquo;s true name remains hidden from the cleric.</p>\n<p>In order to gain the knowledge of a creature&rsquo;s true name (or one of them; many creatures possess a number of secret names of varying power), the cleric must either be within range and have a clear view of the target or possess a personal item or physical component (blood, hair, fingernails, etc.) of the target. If the cleric has a portion of the target&rsquo;s physical body, this spell can be cast at any distance provided that the target is on the same plane of existence as the cleric.</p>\n<p>Once a creature&rsquo;s true name is known, the cleric permanently enjoys the benefits indicated by the spell check below. He can attempt to recast the spell to further deduce the target&rsquo;s secret name(s), but a failure on subsequent castings of the spell makes the target permanently immune to further attempts by the cleric &ndash; he has learned all he can about his target. Due to the complexities and magical nature of true names, the cleric cannot easily share a true name with another person. Attempts to write or speak the true name become garbled in the communication process and the would-be recipient of the name must</p>\n<p>make a spell check with a result equal to or greater than that of the cleric&rsquo;s spell check to comprehend the priest&rsquo;s attempt to share the true name. Failure means it is impossible for the recipient to understand the cleric and he cannot make another attempt to comprehend the true name unless the cleric recasts the spell.</p>\n<p>An individual whose true name has fallen into the possession of another can attempt to nullify that name and negate all&nbsp; bonuses granted to the possessor of the name. This usually requires the intervention of a patron or god, undertaking a quest,&nbsp; subjecting oneself to powerful memory- or identity-erasing magics, or other means determined by the judge.</p><br><p><strong>Manifestation:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.True Name Manifestation]{True Name Manifestation}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d4]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Manifestation</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a divine servant of the cleric’s deity appears and whispers the target’s true name into his ear</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">the true name appears in the air before the cleric, written in celestial fire and visible only to him</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">the cleric is subject to a brief hallucination of the target’s naming at birth;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a nearby animal croaks the target’s true name in a harsh, unearthly voice</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Results:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-cleric.True Name]{True Name}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d20]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Spell Result</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1 - 15</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Failure.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">16 - 17</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The cleric learns the simplest inkling of the targets lesser secret name.

This patron may be a demon, devil, ghost, spirit, elemental, angel, chaos lord, or other supernatural being who accepts the caster&rsquo;s service. The</p>\n<p>initial ceremony takes one week to complete. Once the pact is made, the caster may invoke the patron&rsquo;s support with the spell invoke patron, and it may or may not answer as it sees fit. In return for the patron&rsquo;s assistance, it may ask the caster to do certain things. The caster must act faithfully in its service at all times, lest it cast him off. The caster may perform more than one ceremony to serve multiple masters, but doing so may raise questions as to his true loyalties. This is dangerous magic; a supernatural patron is not the same as the deity that a cleric may worship. The caster should be forewarned that he is in communion with almighty spirits.</p>\n<p>Alternately, once the caster has formed a bond with his patron, this spell may be cast to create a bond between another mortal and the caster&rsquo;s patron. The mortal need not be a spellcaster; in fact, the second mortal usually is not. In this case, both the caster and the recipient must spend a week on the ceremony, which requires a mighty oath to declare allegiance to the patron. Very powerful creatures are more likely to successfully bond with patrons (who look more favorably upon powerful followers). Typically, a casting of patron bond on behalf of another receives a bonus of +2 if the subject is of 5th-level (5 HD) or higher and +4 if the subject is of 9th-level (9 HD) or higher. At the end of the ceremony, the casting of the spell seals the bond.

Line of sight can include scrying devices and crystal balls. The affected creature experiences total amnesia, forgetting its name, its origin, and any and all class abilities. It may retain some skills (such as a warrior's attack bonus, based on years of muscle training) but mental talents (such as spellcasting) are lost.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">34+</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The caster can influence the memories of vast groups of people and potentially even change them. By casting this spell, all creatures within 1 mile are caught within the caster's sphere of forgetfulness. Crea-tures of 1 HD or less are automatically affected, while those of 2+ HD receive a save that is adjudicated by the judge. Creatures that make their save do not have their memories altered, which may leave them feeling crazy when everyone around them remembers something different. <br /><br />The caster can change the common memories of affected creatures in up to three important ways, with all minor details altered collectively to support the change. For example, the caster can change memories of what the king's face looks like, or whether last summer was hot, or the number of cows in Old Man Hanson's field. Additionally, the caster can pick out a total of 10 HD of people within the affected area to affect more substantially. This can be ten characters of 1 HD, or one character of 10 HD, or any combination thereof. <br /><br />These affected creatures receive a second save, and on a failure they experience amnesia to a depth of time defined by the caster: a few weeks, several months, years, or their entire lives.</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>","img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/help.svg","_id":"SKNdz2Gzi8g5IlLZ"}

This patron may be a demon, devil, ghost, spirit, elemental, angel, chaos lord, or other supernatural being who accepts the caster&rsquo;s service. The</p>\n<p>initial ceremony takes one week to complete. Once the pact is made, the caster may invoke the patron&rsquo;s support with the spell invoke patron, and it may or may not answer as it sees fit. In return for the patron&rsquo;s assistance, it may ask the caster to do certain things. The caster must act faithfully in its service at all times, lest it cast him off. The caster may perform more than one ceremony to serve multiple masters, but doing so may raise questions as to his true loyalties. This is dangerous magic; a supernatural patron is not the same as the deity that a cleric may worship. The caster should be forewarned that he is in communion with almighty spirits.</p>\n<p>Alternately, once the caster has formed a bond with his patron, this spell may be cast to create a bond between another mortal and the caster&rsquo;s patron. The mortal need not be a spellcaster; in fact, the second mortal usually is not. In this case, both the caster and the recipient must spend a week on the ceremony, which requires a mighty oath to declare allegiance to the patron. Very powerful creatures are more likely to successfully bond with patrons (who look more favorably upon powerful followers). Typically, a casting of patron bond on behalf of another receives a bonus of +2 if the subject is of 5th-level (5 HD) or higher and +4 if the subject is of 9th-level (9 HD) or higher. At the end of the ceremony, the casting of the spell seals the bond. Recruiting additional followers for his patron brings the caster favor and may grant boons to the other followers; though, their patron will ask fealty of them in exchange.</p>\n<p>Note that continued casting of this spell may taint the caster, both spiritually and physically.</p><br><p><strong>Results:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-wizard.Patron Bond (Self)]{Patron Bond (Self)}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d20]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Spell Result</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Lost and patron taint!

By concentrating, the caster can narrow the focus onto one creature. If he has line of sight, he can focus di-rectly on that creature's thoughts; if the caster has a physical memento (a hair clipping or drop of blood), he can focus directly on that creature (even if not in his line of sight); and if the caster knows a creature personally and it is within range, he can focus on that creature.    <br /><br />All other thoughts remain clouded and indistinct, much like a distant murmur, but the caster can choose to narrow the focus steadily. With a round of concentration, the caster can narrow the thoughts he hears to one category of creatures (for example, 'all men' or 'all warriors' or 'all dwarves'). The caster can then continue to narrow the categories with subsequent rounds of concentration; each time he is aware of how many creatures remain part of the 'murmur' and what general category of creature to which they belong. <br /><br />When there are only a dozen or so creatures left, the caster can sift through individuals, and choose to focus on one, even if it is unfamiliar to him.   When the caster has designated a specific creature, it receives no save if it is 3 HD or less and a Will save if 4 HD or more, but it is not aware of the attempt to read its mind even if it makes the save (the judge should roll). The judge should roll the save for these targets. If the caster is successful, he detects surface-level thoughts: the creature's emotional state, any actions it is intent upon, and so on. By continuing to con-centrate, the caster can continue to read the surface thoughts of the target, as noted in the general spell description. <br /><br />If the caster stops concentrating, the spell continues until the end of the month duration, and he need only focus on another target to resume reading minds.   If the caster chooses, he can 'anchor' his thoughts to those of a single target. This requires seven sequen-tial rounds of concentration, and the target receives a second Will save after the seventh round. It is aware of this attempt and perceives that someone is trying to read its thoughts. If the target fails the save and the caster successfully anchors his thoughts, he remains aware of that target's ongoing thought processes at all times. <br /><br />The caster effectively maintains an ongoing link to read the target's mind. This link lasts until the end of the spell's duration. However, while anchored to one target in this manner, the spell blocks out other background thoughts and the caster cannot hear the 'overall murmur' of other thoughts around him.</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>","img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/psychic-waves.svg","_id":"UzdoWFpNOpfeSvXZ"}

They permanently lose a point of Strength, Stamina, and Agility and may suffer other cosmetic changes (hair goes gray or is lost, wrinkles, liver spots, etc.) at the judge's discretion.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">34 - 35</td>\n<td align=\"left\">All living creatures within the area of effect must make a Fort save or be transformed by the maelstrom. The spell affects the targets' physical make-up, altering flesh and bone into other, less seemly substances. The judge should roll separately for each affected creature, as it is possible for different transformations to affect the targets. Possible transformations include (1) glass, (2) bile, (3) sand, (4) primordial ooze, (5) phlegm, (6) tin, (7) dead vermin, (8) cancerous tissue. <br /><br />The judge may substitute other substances as desired. Transformed creatures can be restored by powerful magics provided circumstances allow the majority of their altered form to be salvageable. For example, a creature transformed into bile while standing in a fast-moving stream has little chance of having all his material form collected and would be lost forever (barring divine intervention).</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">36+</td>\n<td align=\"left\">All mortal creatures within the area of effect are torn apart by the uncaring, chaotic forces that reside in the heart of the cosmos.

Those destroyed by the spell cannot be restored to life by any means, nor can their belongings be recovered or recreated. Entropy wins in the end.</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>","img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/tornado.svg","_id":"aHYjrRoxQfGpdfQV"}

The fireball is a flash explosion and typically does not cause humans to catch fire, but there is a 50% chance that highly flammable objects (such as dry cloth or paper) within the blast area may catch fire.</p><br><p><strong>Manifestation:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Fireball Manifestation]{Fireball Manifestation}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d4]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Manifestation</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a flaming ball that catapults into the target and explodes in a fiery burst</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a stream of liquid flame that douses the target in a raining cloud of fire</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a singularity that appears at a point in space then explodes into a flowering burst of fire</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a collection of spinning, whirling, fiery seeds that bounce forth to the target point, where they explode in flames</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Misfire:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Fireball Misfire]{Fireball Misfire}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d5]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Misfire</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a small fireball explodes on the caster, causing [[/roll 1d6]] damage to him;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a large fireball explodes centered on the caster, causing [[/roll 3d6]] damage to him and all creatures within 20';</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster spontaneously combusts, taking [[/roll 2d6]] damage and causing all flammable objects on him [including clothes and scrolls] to instantaneously crumble to ash;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster summons the wrong element, generating a spray of ice that showers everything within 20' of him, causing no damage but potentially dousing any existing flames;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">5</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster's skin is badly sunburned across his entire body, and physical motion causes sharp pains [expressed as a -1 penalty to all physical actions] until the sunburn heals after one week</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Fireball Corruption]{Fireball Corruption}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d8]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Corruption</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster's hands and arms are blackened like charcoal;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster's skin takes on a charcoal-like hue and texture;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">all hair on the caster's body is burned off, and he is perpetually followed by a vague smell of burning hair;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a small, invisible portal to the elemental plane of fire opens right above the caster and remains open, dripping globules of fire or lava around him on a regular basis; this manifests as sparkling lights around him at all times, and there is a 1% chance each day that a spark will light something on fire at an inopportune time;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">5</td>\n<td align=\"left\">minor corruption;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">6 - 7</td>\n<td align=\"left\">major corruption;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">8</td>\n<td align=\"left\">greater corruption</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Results:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-wizard.Fireball]{Fireball}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d20]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Spell Result</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Lost, failure, and worse!

Instead of projecting from his fingertip, the fireball falls from above like a meteor strike, exploding in a fiery burst. <br /><br />The caster must have line-of-sight to his target, but he can cast around obstructions in this manner.

Note that continued casting of this spell may taint the wizard spiritually and physically.</p><br><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Invoke Patron Corruption]{Invoke Patron Corruption}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d8]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Corruption</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1 - 4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">@Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-tables.ZuGmhXGbhrJIuX9v]{Table 5-3: Minor Corruption}</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">5 - 7</td>\n<td align=\"left\">@Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-tables.Q1zoCQk4Pv0E7ItP]{Table 5-4: Major Corruption}</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">8</td>\n<td align=\"left\">@Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-tables.ueWyXu3ti2dBXsfI]{Table 5-5: Greater Corruption}</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Results:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-wizard.Invoke Patron]{Invoke Patron}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d20]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Spell Result</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Lost, failure, and worse!

This eldritch hunter is a vile creature of the Abyss with no good intentions. This spell requires a minimum of 1 point of spellburn, and that spellburn will not heal until the eldritch hound returns from whence it came. It has no permanent form on the material plane and usually appears as a shadow or steaming mist. The caster must make known to the hound the object or person it seeks in clear and direct terms; ambiguity may result in the wrong target being sought. A physical sample, such as clothing, hair, or a vial of blood, is preferable; a painting, description, name (or true name) is of secondary value. The hound has an extraordinary sense of smell, as well as rudimentary ESP and second sight. Provided with sufficient foundational evidence and a trail to seek, it is usually very successful in finding its target. It will seek and return the specified person or object, dead or alive, to the place where it was first summoned. It has no preference between &ldquo;dead&rdquo; or &ldquo;alive&rdquo; and usually chooses the most expedient manner. Of course, if the object is on a distant continent or in a dangerous labyrinth, the eldritch hound may be in for a long and potentially unsuccessful journey. A caster who attempts to place terms on the hound &ndash; such as to retrieve an object alive or to make a retrieval only at a certain time or after a certain event, may or may not succeed, as noted in the spell check results below.</p>\n<p>Unless noted otherwise, the hound flies at 100&rsquo;, has ability scores of 14, and can perform any action a normal man could perform. It listens but never speaks. It has AC 18, [[/roll 4d12]] hp, attacks at +8 ([[/roll 2d6]] damage), and saves as the caster. It will not fight arbitrarily or even in the caster&rsquo;s defense &ndash; it will only fight to retrieve the specified person or object, and only then if combat is completely unavoidable. It is patient and would prefer to wait than fight. Provided with sufficient information, there is a base chance the hound succeeds in finding the trail of its target (as noted in the spell checks below), though it cannot shift between planes (unless noted otherwise below), and success in locating the object does not always mean success in retrieving it within the indicated time. The judge may modify this base chance as appropriate.</p><br><p><strong>Manifestation:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Eldritch Hound Manifestation]{Eldritch Hound Manifestation}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d4]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Manifestation</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">an invisible presence that makes dogs and horses nervous</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a shadowy thing that never quite comes into focus</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a steamy mist that brings a dank humidity with it</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">a shimmering heat wave that leaps from place to place</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Misfire:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Eldritch Hound Misfire]{Eldritch Hound Misfire}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d3]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Misfire</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">the eldritch hound appears and immediately attacks the caster, fighting to the death;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">the eldritch hound appears and misinterprets its mission, proceeding to track a randomly determined target friendly to the caster;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">the eldritch hound summoned is weak and feeble and becomes associated with the caster's use of this spell in the future, such that when this spell is next cast, there is a 50% chance the feeble hound appears [AC 8, 5 hp, no attack]; such a hound has a -50% chance in finding the trail of its target, and each time it appears, there is a new 50% chance it appears on the next casting, until such time as a casting finally succeeds without it appearing</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Eldritch Hound Corruption]{Eldritch Hound Corruption}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d6]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Corruption</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster's face takes on the appearance of a hound;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster is a magnet to other eldritch hounds, and if one is ever set against him, its chances of success are increased by +25% [minimum 1% chance of failure];</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">whenever the caster attempts any spell going forward, a result of 1 always results in summoning an eldritch hound in addition to any other effects [corruption, misfire, patron taint, etc.], and the eldritch hound summoned makes one angry attack against the caster, then vanishes;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster's skin grows a thin coat of hound-like fur;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">5+</td>\n<td align=\"left\">greater</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Results:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-wizard.Eldritch Hound]{Eldritch Hound}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d20]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Spell Result</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Lost, failure, and worse!

These specialist mages go beyond the capabilities of normal magic-users by studying, pondering, and ultimately completely connecting to the school of arcane magic they choose. A necromancer may live with un-dead</p>\n<p>creatures to fully understand them. A pyromancer may dwell in a volcano. An elementalist may live on one of the four elemental planes, and a conjurer may study the atomic building blocks of matter.</p>\n<p>This spell is the mechanism by which specialty magic happens. This spell forms an affinity between the caster and one kind of magic. This affinity comes after much time and labor is expended and has a cost:</p>\n<p>the spell slot is forever occupied by this very spell, and the caster is forever connected to the arcane element he chooses. However, this spell also has a benefit: it makes the caster more powerful in a specific school of magic.</p>\n<p>Although this spell is listed in the caster&rsquo;s spellbook as the spell arcane affinity, it is really a different spell depending on each caster&rsquo;s goal. It truly represents the time and effort necessary to develop an affinity for a particular school of magic. The &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; is a set of rituals and actions necessary to form the affinity. This is a level 2 spell because a caster must understand the basic principles of magic before he can build an affinity. Traditional affinities and their &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; are as follows. Note the &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; can, in game terms, be considered to overlap with adventuring time or be a lull between adventures.</p>\n<p>&bull; Illusionist: A specialist in spells that alter perceptions or create false images and sounds. An illusionist must spend at least one year understanding how the human body processes sensory input and how it can be fooled.</p>\n<p>&bull; Summoner: A specialist in spells that summon animals, monsters, and other creatures to aid the caster, including elementals and demons. A summoner may further specialize in a particular kind of creatures summoned (e.g., elementals). Summoners may also specialize in summoning objects as well as creatures. A summoner must spend at least one year studying the creatures he wants to summon, both in captivity and in their natural surroundings.</p>\n<p>&bull; Necromancer: A specialist in the un-dead, their creation, their control, and their limits. A necromancer may ultimately pursue eternal life via his own transformation into an un-dead. A necromancer must spend at least one year in the presence of un-dead.</p>\n<p>&bull; Transmuter: A specialist in changing matter from one form to another, whether it be flesh to stone, iron to gold, or something in between. A transmuter must spend at least one year in a laboratory studying the properties of different materials.</p>\n<p>&bull; Pyromancer: A specialist in the study of fire. Pyromancers must spend at least one year in the presence of great flames, such as an active volcano or on the plane of fire. Pyromancers ultimately learn to create, control, and destroy flames at will. There are other specialists who study similar magical powers but control other elements; e.g., fulminators who study electricity, cryomancers who study cold, and aerialists who study air.</p>\n<p>&bull; Demonologist: A specialist in the summoning, control, exorcism, destruction, and lore of demons. This is a dangerous specialty, for demons are never willing to divulge the information necessary to control them. A demonologist must spend at least three years studying ancient tomes, consulting supernatural spirits, and traveling to distant planes to learn what he needs to control demons.</p>\n<p>After a specialist has committed the necessary &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; to specialize in one field, a spell check is made. The spell check determines the benefit of specialization, as noted below. Many specialists utilize spellburn at this point to ensure a good result. Some specialists may attempt ritualized versions of this spell by casting it in a place of power, in concert with other mages, or with an appropriate sacrifice. The ritual rules at the beginning of this chapter, combined with the judge&rsquo;s discretion, determine the nature of the ritual.</p>\n<p>The caster may choose to specialize in more than one field, provided he obeys the dictates given here and in the spell results. Because specialization typically results in improved spellcasting in certain spells and reduced spellcasting in others, a wizard with multiple specialties may find they begin to offset each other.</p><br><p><strong>Misfire:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Arcane Affinity Misfire]{Arcane Affinity Misfire}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d4]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Misfire</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">null</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">null</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">null</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">null</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Arcane Affinity Corruption]{Arcane Affinity Corruption}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d6]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Corruption</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">null</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">null</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">null</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">null</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">5+</td>\n<td align=\"left\">null</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Results:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-wizard.Arcane Affinity]{Arcane Affinity}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d20]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Spell Result</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The affinity fails and the caster automatically suffers corruption.

Each round, the affected must make a Fort save or take [[/roll 1d6]] points of compounded damage every round for CL rounds; i.e., [[/roll 1d6]] on the first round, [[/roll 2d6]] on the second round, [[/roll 3d6]] on the third round, and so on. <br /><br />Success on a Fort save avoids damage only on the current round; it does not stop the spells effect on future rounds. The bacteria devour all organic materials worn or carried by the victims, destroying leather, cloth, wood, and similar materials in [[/roll 1d4]] rounds. A neutralize disease spell destroys the bacteria as does magical flame (fireball, control fire, etc.), but the target takes full damage from the fire.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">34 - 35</td>\n<td align=\"left\">All target within the area of effect must make a Fort save or be stricken with a plague of divine origin. The disease immediately causes  [[/roll 1d10]]+CL damage to the targets and the loss of a point of Luck. The disease continues to ravage the targets bodies after the spell ends and can easily prove fatal. <br /><br />Each subsequent day the target is diseased, it must make a DC 25 Fort save. Failure to do so means they remain ill and suffer the loss of another Luck point and an additional [[/roll 1d6]] damage. Each day after the first, the DC of the Fort save is reduced by 1 until the target makes his save, the disease runs its course, or the disease kills its subject. The disease last for 4 days plus 1 day per CL.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">36 - 37</td>\n<td align=\"left\">All targets with the area of effect must make a Fort save or spontaneously combust! They and all nonmagical possessions burst into flames that do [[/roll 1d10]] points of damage each round they remain on fire. Extinguishing the magical flame requires a full rounds action and the victim must make a DC 20 Ref check to put out the fire. The fires continue until extinguished or the victim dies.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">38+</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The gaze of the clerics deity turns upon the heathens within the area of effect and completely decimates all who fail their Fort save. The targets melt into pools of bloody slime and runny flesh that quickly evaporates as if they had never been. <br /><br />Due to the deitys personal involvement in this effect, all spell checks by the cleric suffer a -10 penalty for a full week afterwards. His deity has helped him enough and is likely to ignore any further requests until a weeks time has passed. This modifier can be removed at the judges discretion if the cleric undertakes a great task in his deitys name.</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>","img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/heptagram.svg"}

If the caster consults with his patron (per the patron bond spell) or one of the patron&rsquo;s servants, add +1 to the spell check. If the caster consults with another specific spirit known to him from prior contact, legend, logical deduction (e.g., the</p>\n<p>caster sees a dead body and wishes to find its ghost), or research (e.g., the caster has visited his altar or read of his exploits), there is no modifier. If the caster has no knowledge of the spirit consulted, merely wishes to contact any spirit that will answer, or deliberately contacts a spirit of opposed alignment or interests, subtract -1 from the spell check.</p>\n<p>If the spirit is known to the caster, roll d% to determine its attitude: (01-20) friendly, (21-80) neutral, (81-00) hostile. A friendly or neutral spirit answers honestly to the best of its ability and has a base 50% chance of knowing the answer to any given question appropriate to its area of knowledge, modified by the judge&rsquo;s discretion and the obscurity of the question. When questioning a hostile spirit, roll d%: it (01-50) provides misleading information; (51-80) refuses to answer; (81-95) attempts to probe the caster&rsquo;s</p>\n<p>mind (Will save vs. DC of [[/roll 4d6]] or take [[/roll 1d4]] temporary Int damage); or (96-100) uses this connection to attempt enter the material plane.</p>\n<p>Note that establishing contact in this manner also enables the spirit to establish reverse contact on future</p>\n<p>occasions (by casting this same spell, if it is able, or other similar abilities). Furthermore, not all spirits are pleased at an interruption from a curious mortal. The ghost of a recently slain creature, for example, is probably quite angry at its death, and there may be consequences for awakening it.</p><br><p><strong>Manifestation:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Demon Summoning - Patron Manifestation]{Demon Summoning - Patron Manifestation}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d4]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Manifestation</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">an egg shimmers into existence, then hatches into the demon summoned</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">flash of dark clouds and demon appears</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">demon’s skeleton appears first, then organs appear, then muscles knit them together, then skin grows and the demon appears</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">demon erupts from ground fully formed</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Demon Summoning - Patron Corruption]{Demon Summoning - Patron Corruption}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d8]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Corruption</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster's face takes on the appearance of the demon he attempted to summon;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster's body takes on aspects of the demon he attempted to summon;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster's face becomes pock-marked and he temporarily loses [[/roll 1d4]] points of Int as demon struggles violently with the casting attempt;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">caster wheezes and has trouble breathing in the presence of demons of the type he attempted to summon;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">5</td>\n<td align=\"left\">minor corruption;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">6</td>\n<td align=\"left\">major corruption;</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">7+</td>\n<td align=\"left\">greater corruption</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Results:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-wizard.Demon Summoning - Patron]{Demon Summoning - Patron}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d20]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Spell Result</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Lost, failure, and worse!

The area of effect is 50' square and 10' in height. All air-breathing creatures within the cloud must make a Fort save or be incapacitated by wracking coughs and suffer [[/roll 1d6]]+CL damage each round. <br /><br />Those that make their saves take no damage and may act freely, but the cough imposes a -3 penalty to all attacks, saves, spell checks, ability checks, and initiative rolls until the spell's duration expires. The cloud last for 1 round per CL.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">20 - 23</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The caster grows thick, leathery fungi over his body that prevents him from taking damage. This ablative armor protects the caster from a number of attacks equal to his CL. Each time the caster takes physical damage, he can make a Fort save with a DC equal to the amount of damage the attack caused. A successful save indicates damage, but the attack is deducted from the amount of defensive armor remaining. <br /><br />For example, a 10th level caster is protected against ten attacks. If he successfully makes his Fort save, he takes no damage and retains protection against nine more attacks. A failed Fort save indicates the caster takes normal damage, but doesn't reduce the amount of remaining armor. <br /><br />The fungus armor only defends against physical attacks of a magical or non-magical nature and provides no protection against psychic, illusionary, or other mental attacks. The armor remains until destroyed, dispelled, or for 1 hour per CL.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">24 - 25</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The caster summons thick, ropey strands of fungus that emerge from the ground and restrain and crush his enemies. These pale tendrils sprout in an area 60' square and attack all targets within that space. Each tendril attacks with a +4 bonus to hit. <br /><br />A successful strike indicates the target is entangled by the tendril and cannot move. In addition, the fungus constricts and targets suffer [[/roll 1d8+4]] damage each round until freed or the spell ends. A successful Ref saving throw by the entangled target indicates its arms are free and it can attempt to attack the tendrils with a weapon or cast a spell. <br /><br />These attempts suffer a -4 penalty. Tendrils have an AC of 15 and 25 hit points. A trapped target can also free itself with a DC 25 Strength check or an appropriate Mighty Deed of Arms at the judge's discretion.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">26 - 28</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The caster calls up thick stands of giant mushrooms to block passages, form protective walls, or create spongy ramps to reach higher ground. The amount of fungi generated can fill an area up to 150' square and 10' in height. <br /><br />It can be molded to take the shape of walls, pillars, cubes, ramps, and other solid shapes provided it has solid ground upon which to rest. Bridges, arches, and other curved forms are also allowed, but complete spheres are beyond the spell's ability. The caster can create openings in the fungi such as doorways, arrow slits, and vents at the time of the spell's casting, but later additions need be cut into the spongy material with edged weapons or tools. <br /><br />The fungi last for 30 minutes per CL and dissolves into a smelly, slimy mass once the spell ends. Hacking a man-sized hole through 10' of fungi requires 10 minutes of work; additional workers can reduce this time by 1 minute per assistant.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">29 - 33</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The caster calls into being a horde of shroomen to do his bidding. These laconic creatures emerge from the ground as puffballs that break open to reveal the fungoid humanoids within. The caster calls up 2 shroomen per CL. They remain under the caster's complete control until destroyed or released from service, upon which they depart slowly but peacefully. The shroomen have typical stats for their species.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">34 - 35</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The caster taps into the psychotropic nature of certain fungi to forge a mystic connection with the unseen realms. While under the effects of this hallucinogenic state, attempts to contact patrons, call for divine aid, summon demons, or use divination magic enjoy a +8 bonus to their spell checks if performed within the next hour. <br /><br />However, meddling with magic in this state can be detrimental to one's sanity. If the modified spell check fails, the caster must make a Will save or go permanently insane. Certain restorative magics may be able to restore the caster's sanity, but he never fully shakes the terrors he witnessed while under the psychotropic effects of this spell.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">36 - 37</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The caster causes the natural fungi that exist on and inside living creatures to rebel against their hosts, turning on them and destroying them from the inside out. The caster can affect a number of creatures within range equal to his CL. Each target must make a Fort save or suffer the effects of protoplasmic breakdown (see primeval slime). <br /><br />This destruction lasts for a number of rounds equal to the caster's CL but can be stopped with neutralize poison or disease with a spell check of 30+. Otherwise, the afflicted creature suffer [[/roll 1d4]] Stamina loss each round until the spell runs its course. The spell lasts CL rounds.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">38+</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The caster contacts Mycetes-Thrax, the Great Sleeping Growth that lurks beneath the soil. This titanic entity is a single fungus that stretches for a hundred leagues under the earth and has grown sentient and wise with the eons. Mycetes-Thrax can serve as a patron if the caster knows the proper spells, and it rewards its servants with utterly alien but useful and fearsome powers (of the judge's choosing). <br /><br />Its wisdom is great and it knows much forgotten lore. The caster can ask a number of questions of Mycetes-Thrax equal to his CL, which it answers truthfully (if slowly). The judge will deem whether the Sleeping Growth knows the answers. Lastly, if the caster desires destruction, Mycetes-Thrax can ripple its great, slumbering corpus, causing destructive earthquakes, tsunamis, and avalanches in locations up to 300 miles away</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>","img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/spotted-mushroom.svg","_id":"qTV5jIwEfk5F1FNf"}

If a target being pushed back impacts an obstruction before hitting the edge of the cone, it takes [[/roll 1d14]] damage and is pinned against the obstruction until it makes a DC 28 Strength check or the wind dies down.

The gust of wind travels up to 400' in all directions and can vector in a manner designated. <br /><br />For example, the caster could send the wind up into the sky or push targets down into the ground. Creatures that are at a vertical height when the wind diminishes take normal falling damage ([[/roll 1d6]] per 10' fallen). The caster can use this massive burst to send an entire army to the edges of the windstorm. All creatures in the affected area must make a DC 30 Strength check or be forced back to the edge of the effect. Unattended objects of less than 400 pounds are also pushed back. If a target being pushed back impacts an obstruction before hitting the edge of the cone, it takes [[/roll 1d16]] damage and is pinned against the obstruction until it makes a DC 30 Strength check or the wind dies down. <br /><br />All flames in the area are automatically extinguished. The gust of wind continues for up to 20 rounds for as long as the caster continues to concentrate.

The storm lasts for [[/roll 1d4]] turns (no concentration required) or until the caster ends the effect. The caster can protect a \"bubble\" centered around him and up to 40' in diameter. All other creatures within 1,000' in all directions are affected. All creatures are jostled by the winds for [[/roll 1d6]] damage per round and steadily pushed by the winds to the outer edges of the storm at a rate of 100' per round (DC 30 Strength check to resist). <br /><br />If a target being pushed back impacts an obstruction before hitting the edge of the cone, it takes [[/roll 1d20]] damage and is pinned against the obstruction until it makes a DC 30 Strength check or the wind dies down. In addition, creatures caught within the area of effect are struck by myriad flashes of ball lightning, taking [[/roll 2d6]]-4 points of lightning damage each round (result of 0 or less indicates no lightning strikes this round). <br /><br />All caught within the gust are soaking wet; all flames are extinguished; and torches are difficult to re-light because of the moisture. Unattended objects of less than 500 pounds are also pushed back to the edge of the thunderstorm. It is impossible to launch missile fire weapons in the thunderstorm.</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>","img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/wind-slap.svg","_id":"v8gZXcw8QPk7IQl0"}

The staff also emits light in a 20' radius, which can be turned on or off and vary in intensity from candlelight to full daylight, at the caster's discretion. <br /><br />During the casting time, the caster may attempt to cast three other spells he knows.

The staff also grants a +1 bonus to saving throws and armor class or a +2 bonus if the original caster level is 4 or higher. Additionally, the caster can imbue the staff with fixed charges associated with the three spells he casts. For the first spell, he makes a spell check. If it succeeds, he makes another spell check for the same spell, a number of times up to his caster level. For example, a level 4 caster could make up to 4 checks if each succeeds. <br /><br />Then he repeats this process for the second and third spells. For each check that succeeds, he imbues the staff with 1 charge of the relevant spell. For example, the level 4 caster could put up to 12 charges in the staff if every check succeeded (3 spells x 4 castings per spell = 12 charges). Thenceforth, the caster may burn those charges to cast the three spells stored in the staff, making a normal spell check to cast the spell, modified by the +1 or +2 bonus associated with that spell. Once expended, the charges are lost unless renewed. Renewal requires a modified casting of this spell, with a casting time of 1 week and no materials or spellburn required; if this modified version succeeds at DC 30 or better, the caster can repeat the process above to restore the castings, but cannot exceed the original number of charges. <br /><br />For example: a level 4 caster attempts to burn the spells sleep, spider web, and strength into his staff. The minimum successful check result for sleep (a level 1 spell) is DC 12. His check results are 14, 16, 12, and 9. The first three checks succeed, so he imbues three charges into his staff. For spider web (a level 2 spell with minimum check result of DC 14), his first check is a 19 but his second check is a 12. He manages to imbue only one charge into the staff. Finally, he casts strength (minimum check result of DC 14) and rolls 20, 19, 17, and 18  four successes! <br /><br />The final tally is a staff with 8 charges: 3x sleep, 1x spider web, and 4x strength. Because he was CL 4 when casting, each of these spells is cast with a +2 bonus.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">34+</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The caster succeeds in crafting a simple staff, which is linked to his soul.

For example, the cleric can change a sling stone into a spider, an arrow to an asp, or a staff into a serpent. The specifics are as follows:</p>\n<p>&bull; At low levels of effect (see below), the cleric can transform a small object into a poisonous spider. The object can be a coin, gem, sling stone, apple, beer mug, or other such small thing. The spell descriptions below assume a sling stone is used. For the spell&rsquo;s duration, the object retains its natural shape until it touches an enemy. So, for example, the cleric can hide a gemstone in a chest, which transforms into a spider when grasped; or launch an attack with his sling, and the stone transforms into a spider or scorpion when it strikes the enemy. Once the object touches an enemy (either through their grasp or via a successful hit as with a sling stone), it transforms into a spider, which remains for a certain amount of time. The spider receives one bite immediately on the round of attack and one additional bite each round until the spell ends. (A missed sling stone does not transform.) It reverts to its natural shape at the end of the spell. The poisonous spider is AC 14 (due to small size and agility) and has only 1 hp, but immediately scurries toward exposed flesh and strikes the enemy. On the first bite, the spider&rsquo;s attack automatically hits, causing damage 1 + poison. The target must make a Fort save against the spell check DC or suffer poison as per a (roll [[/roll 1d3]]) (1) black widow; (2) tarantula; or (3) scorpion (see Appendix P). On future rounds the spider must make an attack roll at Atk +2 in order to inflict damage. Note that the spider continues to scurry about and bite for the duration of the spell. Strikes against it that miss have a 50% chance of hitting the spell&rsquo;s target for damage.</p>\n<p>&bull;At medium levels of effect (see below), the cleric can transform an arrow into an asp or adder. (He could also transform other similarly shaped objects into an asp or adder: a stick of wood, a lever, a metal rod, etc.) As above, the object retains its natural shape until it touches an enemy, at which point it transforms. The asp or adder receives one bite immediately on the round of attack and one additional bite each round until the spell ends. The first bite automatically hits, causing damage 2 +</p>\n<p>poison. The target must make a Fort save against the spell check DC or suffer the poison of an asp or adder (see Appendix P). On future rounds the snake must make an attack roll at Atk +4 in order to inflict damage. Note that the snake continues to slither about and bite for the duration of the spell. Strikes against it that miss have a 50% chance of hitting the spell&rsquo;s target for damage.</p>\n<p>&bull; At the highest levels of effect (see below), the cleric can transform a staff into a cobra or viper. (He could also transform other similarly shaped objects into a cobra: a tree branch, a pole arm, etc.) In this case, each time the cleric strikes with the staff, it transforms into a serpent, bites, and then transforms back into a staff. The serpent-staff is treated as a +4 magical weapon, so it attacks at the cleric&rsquo;s normal attack bonus with an additional +4 modifier. Any successful attack causes normal weapon damage, +4 for the magical modifier, and inflicts poison as per a cobra or viper strike (see Appendix P). The Fort save against the poison is the spell check result. If the cleric strikes with the staff and then releases it, the staff remains in serpent form and continues to attack with its bite for the duration of the spell; in this case, it attacks at Atk +6 and inflicts damage of [[/roll 1d4+4]] plus poison.</p>\n<p>In all cases, the transformed spider or serpent is wild and uncontrolled. It will not obey commands from the cleric. An arrow that transforms into an asp, for example, cannot be commanded to return to the cleric after killing its target. It will simply slither off like any wild snake.</p><br><p><strong>Results:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-cleric.Stinging Stone]{Stinging Stone}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d20]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Spell Result</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1 - 13</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Failure.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">14 - 15</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The cleric can transform a single small object, up to the size of a sling stone, into a poisonous spider.

{"name":"Sword Magic","sort":100001,"content":"<h1>Sword Magic</h1><p><strong>Level:</strong> 3</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Permanent</p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Month+</p><p><strong>Save:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Page:</strong> 229</p><br><p>Magic weapons can be created by spellcasters using this spell. A spell check determines the possible abilities and properties of the weapon to be created. The specifics are determined by the material components, craftsmanship, and other elements incorporated by the caster. This spell is cast as an ongoing ritual through the weapon-forging process, and the caster may need a partner to forge the weapon if he is not a blacksmith himself. Spellburn utilized in the casting is lost for the duration of the casting and only heals when the spell is complete. All costs are expended before the spell check is made, and failure means all costs are lost; a weapon that is unsuccessfully enchanted can be re-forged to recover half the material costs involved. Generally speaking, follow this process to create a magic weapon:</p>\n<p><strong>Forge the weapon:</strong> The weapon must be forged while this spell is cast. A dagger, short sword, long sword, or two-handed sword is easily enchanted. Using this spell to enchant other kinds of weapons entails a -1 penalty to the spell check, increased to -2 if the caster is not proficient with the weapon in question. Construction of the physical weapon itself costs a minimum of 100x the cost of a normal weapon of that type in raw materials of the highest quality, plus any wages paid to the blacksmith(s).</p>\n<p><strong>The basic enchantment:</strong> The spell check determines the basic enchantment. The caster&rsquo;s level determines the maximum possible effectiveness of the weapon: CL5 = +1, CL6 = +2, CL7 = +3, CL8 = +4, CL10 = +5. Make the spell check and compare the result to Table 8-4 to determine the &ldquo;plus&rdquo; of the weapon. The cost of a plus, in addition to the weapon itself, is as follows, reflected in extraordinarily rare materials: +1 = 5,000 gp; +2 = 10,000 gp; +3 = 50,000 gp; +4 = 500,000 gp; +5 = 1,000,000 gp.</p>\n<p><strong>The weapon&rsquo;s intelligence:</strong> A magic weapon is always intelligent. The single spell check determines the basic enchantment, the weapon&rsquo;s intelligence, and all other aspects of the magic sword. Reference Table 8-4 to determine the dice rolled for the weapon&rsquo;s Intelligence and how it communicates. The weapon has a personality that is a blend of the caster&rsquo;s, the blacksmith involved, patrons invoked, and any other particulars of its creation (a dragon-bane weapon may be arrogant like a dragon).</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> A magic weapon is usually, but not always, the same alignment as its creator. Reference Table 8-3 for the result of the spell check. Weapons of different alignments than their creators will not be easy to use.</p>\n<p><strong>Banes:</strong> A magic weapon can be constructed for the purpose of slaying a particular kind of foe. Reference Table 8-4 to determine the number of potential banes at any given spell check result and Table 8-5 for the effects of various banes. Each bane built into a weapon costs from 20,000 to 100,000 gp and requires voluminous material samples of the creature type in question (for example, a dozen dragon corpses or 100 orcs). The cost depends on the level of effect and is at the discretion of the judge (i.e., the most deadly result of instant death costs the most, while the simplest result of a bonus to hit is the cheapest). The caster must declare what kind of banes he is trying to instill in his weapon. Depending on the spell check, he may be successful in none, some, or all of those. If a limited number is granted, the judge randomly determines which are successful.</p>\n<p><strong>Special purpose:</strong> A magic weapon always has a special purpose, and it is not always under the control of the caster. The special purpose is determined by the most recondite of factors, ranging from astrological signs to natural terrain to the most subtle properties used in the crafting of the weapon. Table 8-4 indicates the dice rolled for a weapon&rsquo;s special purpose, based on the spell check; those dice are then rolled on table 8-6. The result is always random, then the caster can utilize spellburn to shift the table&rsquo;s results. For every point of spellburn, he can increase or decrease his roll by 1 point. This spellburn is determined after rolling for the special purpose. The level of spellburn employed determines the caster&rsquo;s knowledge of the process and how carefully he can actually influence the result of his crafting. Under certain circumstances, particularly if a caster has a powerful patron, the judge may choose a special purpose that is aligned with the caster&rsquo;s patron or some other greater power. There is no gp cost to a special purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Powers:</strong> Sword powers come in three varieties: type I, type II, and type III (see tables 8-7, 8-8, and 8-9). The special check determines which powers a sword may have. The caster pays a cost to imbue a sword with powers: 10,000 gp for each type I power, 20,000 gp for each type II power, and 50,000 for each type III power. Depending on the result of the spell check, the weapon will have some number of those powers evident at the completion of the casting. It is quite possible that the caster will spend the money to imbue the powers but his spell check will not be sufficient to complete them, or his spell check results in a percentile chance which does not yield those powers.</p>\n<p><strong>Creation properties:</strong> Several of the entries above note specialized circumstances that can influence a sword&rsquo;s final traits. These creation properties are sometimes known factors, and other times are incidental events that affect the creation process inadvertently. Here are some potential creation properties, which can be used by the player to attempt to influence the final weapon created and by the judge to introduce unusual purposes or powers beyond the intent of the creator. Creation properties: crafter (not necessarily caster) is an elf, dwarf, giant, god, demon, last of a line, a wronged king, or seventh son; weapon is crafted on the plane of fire (or in a volcano or lava lake), on the plane of water (or under the sea, deep in a lake, or on a sailing ship), on the plane of earth (or far below in the underdeep, or within a mine), on the plane of air (or on a cloud, or atop a mountain above the clouds), on the plane of a demon prince or one of the Nine Hells, in the lair of a great dragon, in a graveyard or ossuary, a lich&rsquo;s crypt, a vampire&rsquo;s coffin, or a mummy&rsquo;s tomb, on a great battlefield, or in the fey lands; date of crafting is the birthday of a prince, the day a witch is hanged, or on the death of a god; moment of completion is at sunset, sunrise, high noon, during a full moon, during an eclipse; material components of sword include remnants of a pegasus, dragon, demon, un-dead, etc.; creator&rsquo;s Luck is at a certain level; iron or wood from which sword is forged is from a specific place; creator&rsquo;s spoken language includes a certain tongue; and so on.</p><br><p><strong>Misfire:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Sword Magic Misfire]{Sword Magic Misfire}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d1]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Misfire</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">N/A</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-effect-tables.Sword Magic Corruption]{Sword Magic Corruption}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d8]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Corruption</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1 - 3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Minor Corruption</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">4 - 6</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Major Corruption</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">7+</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Greater Corruption</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><br><p><strong>Results:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-wizard.Sword Magic]{Sword Magic}</p><br><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup width=\"34\"></colgroup> \n<colgroup width=\"365\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\"><strong>[[/roll 1d20]]</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Spell Result</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Lost and corruption.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td align=\"left\" height=\"17\">2 - 15</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Lost.
