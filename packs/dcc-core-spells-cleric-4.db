{"name":"Sanctify/Desecrate","permission":{"default":0,"U5X07uKi3FMVWkQ1":3},"type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The cleric dedicates a physical space to his deity, granting it supernatural protection and attuning it to the will and agenda of his divine master. This sanctum becomes a refuge for the cleric and other worshippers of the deity. The spell can also be cast upon a space already sacrosanct to another deity. If the cleric&rsquo;s spell check is greater than that of the cleric who originally sanctified the space, the area becomes desecrated and no longer grants any benefits to those within. A space that has been desecrated must be cleansed of any lingering traces of its former divine connection (a month-long process) before it can be sanctified to a new deity. No cleansing is necessary to re-sanctify a space to its former divine protector.</p>\n<p>The cleric, worshippers of the cleric&rsquo;s deity, and those of the same alignment of the cleric gain the full benefit of the sanctuary as determined by the spell check. Those of a different alignment who worship a deity not in direct opposition to the cleric&rsquo;s deity gain half the normal benefits of the sanctuary (rounded up), i.e. a cleric of a different, but not antagonistic, god would receive a +1 bonus to laying on hands if the cleric who cast the sanctify/desecrate spell scored a 20 on her spell check. Individuals who are unholy (according to the cleric&rsquo;s faith) or worship a deity opposed to the casting cleric&rsquo;s own suffer a negative penalty equal the bonus the sanctuary provides true believers and may be subject to physical damage as well.</p>\n<p>Each sanctuary provides a bonus to spell checks, turning, laying on hands, and pleas for divine aid. In addition, the sanctuary provides a bonus to actions related to the deity to which it is dedicated. The judge must adjudicate these bonuses on a deity-by-deity basis, but they should always apply to actions favorable to the deity. For example, a sanctuary dedicated to Klazath, god of war, would modify all combat rolls made by the cleric and his followers while within the sacred space. The devotees of Amun Tor, god of mysteries and riddles, would gain the sanctuary&rsquo;s bonus to rolls made to decipher codes or uncover hidden clues; while those of Bobugbubilz, demon lord of evil amphibians, would discover that all batrachian servants or summoned creatures within the sanctuary add the bonus to their hit points, saving throws, and attack rolls.</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Sanctify/Desecrate]{Sanctify/Desecrate}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","summary":""},"source":"","config":{"inheritSpellCheck":true},"available":true,"level":4,"range":"20 square area per CL","duration":"Varies","page":"298","castingTime":"1 turn","results":{"table":"Sanctify/Desecrate","collection":"dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-cleric"},"save":"See below","spellCheck":{"die":"1d20","value":0},"mercurialEffect":{"value":null,"summary":"","description":""}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/star-altar.svg","effects":[],"_id":"Xah3Rgu0Y2i2FFnO"}
