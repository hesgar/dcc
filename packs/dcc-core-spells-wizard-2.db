{"name":"Arcane Affinity","permission":{"default":0,"U5X07uKi3FMVWkQ1":3},"type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Some wizards choose to specialize in a particular kind of magic. They may be necromancers who study the lore of un-dead or pyromancers who control fire. They may be elementalists who can control free-willed elementals or summoners who bring material objects into existence from nowhere. These specialist mages go beyond the capabilities of normal magic-users by studying, pondering, and ultimately completely connecting to the school of arcane magic they choose. A necromancer may live with un-dead</p>\n<p>creatures to fully understand them. A pyromancer may dwell in a volcano. An elementalist may live on one of the four elemental planes, and a conjurer may study the atomic building blocks of matter.</p>\n<p>This spell is the mechanism by which specialty magic happens. This spell forms an affinity between the caster and one kind of magic. This affinity comes after much time and labor is expended and has a cost:</p>\n<p>the spell slot is forever occupied by this very spell, and the caster is forever connected to the arcane element he chooses. However, this spell also has a benefit: it makes the caster more powerful in a specific school of magic.</p>\n<p>Although this spell is listed in the caster&rsquo;s spellbook as the spell arcane affinity, it is really a different spell depending on each caster&rsquo;s goal. It truly represents the time and effort necessary to develop an affinity for a particular school of magic. The &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; is a set of rituals and actions necessary to form the affinity. This is a level 2 spell because a caster must understand the basic principles of magic before he can build an affinity. Traditional affinities and their &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; are as follows. Note the &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; can, in game terms, be considered to overlap with adventuring time or be a lull between adventures.</p>\n<p>&bull; Illusionist: A specialist in spells that alter perceptions or create false images and sounds. An illusionist must spend at least one year understanding how the human body processes sensory input and how it can be fooled.</p>\n<p>&bull; Summoner: A specialist in spells that summon animals, monsters, and other creatures to aid the caster, including elementals and demons. A summoner may further specialize in a particular kind of creatures summoned (e.g., elementals). Summoners may also specialize in summoning objects as well as creatures. A summoner must spend at least one year studying the creatures he wants to summon, both in captivity and in their natural surroundings.</p>\n<p>&bull; Necromancer: A specialist in the un-dead, their creation, their control, and their limits. A necromancer may ultimately pursue eternal life via his own transformation into an un-dead. A necromancer must spend at least one year in the presence of un-dead.</p>\n<p>&bull; Transmuter: A specialist in changing matter from one form to another, whether it be flesh to stone, iron to gold, or something in between. A transmuter must spend at least one year in a laboratory studying the properties of different materials.</p>\n<p>&bull; Pyromancer: A specialist in the study of fire. Pyromancers must spend at least one year in the presence of great flames, such as an active volcano or on the plane of fire. Pyromancers ultimately learn to create, control, and destroy flames at will. There are other specialists who study similar magical powers but control other elements; e.g., fulminators who study electricity, cryomancers who study cold, and aerialists who study air.</p>\n<p>&bull; Demonologist: A specialist in the summoning, control, exorcism, destruction, and lore of demons. This is a dangerous specialty, for demons are never willing to divulge the information necessary to control them. A demonologist must spend at least three years studying ancient tomes, consulting supernatural spirits, and traveling to distant planes to learn what he needs to control demons.</p>\n<p>After a specialist has committed the necessary &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; to specialize in one field, a spell check is made. The spell check determines the benefit of specialization, as noted below. Many specialists utilize spellburn at this point to ensure a good result. Some specialists may attempt ritualized versions of this spell by casting it in a place of power, in concert with other mages, or with an appropriate sacrifice. The ritual rules at the beginning of this chapter, combined with the judge&rsquo;s discretion, determine the nature of the ritual.</p>\n<p>The caster may choose to specialize in more than one field, provided he obeys the dictates given here and in the spell results. Because specialization typically results in improved spellcasting in certain spells and reduced spellcasting in others, a wizard with multiple specialties may find they begin to offset each other.</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Arcane Affinity]{Arcane Affinity}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","summary":""},"source":"","config":{"inheritSpellCheck":true},"available":true,"level":2,"range":"Self","duration":"Varies","page":"162","castingTime":"Varies","results":{"table":"Arcane Affinity","collection":"dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-wizard"},"save":"N/A","spellCheck":{"die":"1d20","value":0},"mercurialEffect":{"value":null,"summary":"","description":""}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/abstract-085.svg","effects":[],"_id":"3FyTDf2l0HD8UP5v"}
