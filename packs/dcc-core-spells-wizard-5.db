Hunters cannot cross magical barriers but will wait patiently for wards to expire or for prey to leave the protected area. Slaying a hunter causes the spell to end and a new hunter cannot be sent against the target until 1 month has passed.</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Lokerimon's Unerring Hunter]{Lokerimon's Unerring Hunter}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","summary":""},"source":"","config":{"inheritSpellCheck":true},"available":true,"level":5,"range":"Varies","duration":"Varies","page":"249","castingTime":"10 minutes","results":{"table":"Lokerimon's Unerring Hunter","collection":"dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-wizard"},"save":"None","spellCheck":{"die":"1d20","value":0},"mercurialEffect":{"value":null,"summary":"","description":""}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/hunting-horn.svg","effects":[],"_id":"AfEH8CPFfFHJgQyD"}
