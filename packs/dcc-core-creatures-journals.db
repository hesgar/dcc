The elemental planes stand outside the cycle of growth and decay, roiling and reconstituting the same elements in an eternal, ongoing genesis, with their only change being the steady ebb and flow of elemental energies to the material plane. Elementals are the living, pseudo-intelligent manifestations of their planes, composed of the primal elements with no pollution from other materials. For the most part they are neutral in nature, acting as would animals in a forest. Their planes do harbor other kinds of life, including elemental princes who have taken sides in the eternal struggle between law and chaos, other natives (such as water weirds, salamanders, fire snakes, aerial servants, and hell hounds), and intelligent rulers (such as djinni), but the elementals themselves remain pure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are four elemental creatures: fire, earth, water, and air. In the spaces between these planes dwell the four pseudo-elementals: ash, lava, ice, and mist. Other minor elementals also exist at the rarest intersections of the planes: dust, steam, and mud.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Elementals are common on their native planes but extremely rare on the material plane. They are encountered when conjured or summoned by a wizard, in proximity to the few natural vortices that allow passage to the elemental planes, in places where the dimensional fabric has been torn, and in extreme concentrations of the elements that are pleasing to their senses (e.g., great oceanic depths, veins of rare minerals, colossal tornadoes, and volcanic pits). In a few cases they wander naturally when summoned by a wizard who died without breaking the spell&mdash;these elementals are trapped and cannot return, but are also without a master.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All elementals share these traits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As extraplanar creatures, they are impervious to normal attacks. They can only be wounded normally by magic weapons, spells, other extraplanar denizens, or creatures with naturally magical attacks (including paralysis, sleep, poison, acid, breath weapon, etc.). Creatures of at least 4 HD are powerful enough to wound an elemental for half damage, and creatures of at least 6 HD can cause normal damage.</li>\n<li>A summoned or conjured elemental must be controlled by a wizard in order for its actions to be directed. The controlling wizard must concentrate. If his concentration is broken, he may lose control of the elemental. Free-willed elementals attack in a rage, targeting the creatures that have dealt them damage or controlled them. After [[/roll 1d6]] rounds they return to their original plane if they are able to do so.</li>\n<li>A wizard can attempt to take control of a free-willed elemental by casting the appropriate spell. When it comes to controlled elementals, a wizard can attempt to wrest control from another wizard by casting dispel magic against the controlling wizard&rsquo;s source of control, then casting the appropriate spell to control the elemental himself.</li>\n<li>Elementals that appear on the material plane have 8, 12, or 16 HD, depending on the mode of summoning. Elementals on their native planes are even more powerful and may possess 20 or more HD. Elementals of 12 or 16 HD receive one extra action die.

Demons appear on the physical plane of existence when summoned, invoked, or bound, or occasionally, when visiting voluntarily. Demons find mortals repugnant and are disgusted by our blue skies and green vistas, and thus rarely visit corporeal realms except by compulsory means. On the other hand, they thrive on the energy in a human soul and are eager to take possession of souls that pass on to the afterlife. Demons that do find themselves stranded on the material plane may become more powerful by consuming the souls of those they meet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The physics of extraplanar reality produce different forms of life, and thus demons have a variety of forms. Powerful demons may be unique in stature, and over a lifetime any given demon may change its form in subtle or dramatic fashion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By mortal standards, demons are incredibly powerful and possess great magical powers. The impermanent nature of the outer planes manifests on the primary plane as an ability to alter physical reality, and thus many demons discover new powers when they visit our plane. Sorcerers pursue means to tap and control these powers, whether by forcibly binding demons to specific ends or by trading favors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Demon planes are organized hierarchically. A demon typically owes fealty to a more powerful specimen and has some vassals of its own. Even the weakest demons bully lower life forms into submission. Powerful demons build strongholds and organize followers into armies, then war for control of their realms. A few ultra-powerful demon lords rule entire planes and serve as patrons for ambitious mortals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many mortals choose to serve demon lords in the pursuit of power. This is not a path to take lightly. While demons may bestow boons upon the faithful, they are likewise quick to punish those who fail, and capricious enough to revoke past gifts if so provoked. Wizards may declare fealty to a demon lord with the patron bond spell, while clerics can meditate and pray in the name of a demon lord.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A wizard can attempt to take control of a demon by casting the appropriate spell. The spell binding is the most basic method for this control, while demon summoning will summon a controlled demon for a limited duration. Demons that are slain on a non-native plane are not truly killed; they re-form on their native plane at a later time. Powerful demons may keep their life essence in a hidden vessel, which must be located and destroyed to truly kill them; otherwise, even if &ldquo;slain,&rdquo; they simply re-form at the place of their life essence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All demons are unique individuals, but they can be roughly classed as follows. Demons of each type share certain abilities and resistances, as indicated in their descriptions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All demons roll on crit table DN and feature a threat range depending on their type, as noted below. While a natural 20 is always a hit, scoring a crit on another roll requires the demon to roll the natural result and beat the target&rsquo;s AC.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are many demon lords and many thousands of demons. The table below lists some of the demons most applicable to a beginning DCC RPG campaign, organized by the demon lord to which they report. Stats are presented only for the demons of Bobugbubilz; the rest are yours to create.

They cluster in swarms of up to 20 creatures. Individually they are durable, but their weak bite is not to be feared. However, in numbers, their buzzing calls cause duress to humanoids. Instead of moving and attacking, a cave cricket can spend its entire round rasping its legs against each other. The low-pitched buzzing noise produced by this action is extremely painful to humanoids. For every cave cricket participating in the buzzing, roll [[/roll 1d4]]. Sum the total and compare it to the Stamina of characters within 100&rsquo; of the cave crickets. Any character with a Stamina less than the total automatically takes damage equal to the difference between the roll and his Stamina. For example, a group of six cave crickets would roll [[/roll 6d4]] when they buzz. If the result was a roll of 16, and the nearest character has a Stamina of 12, that character would take 4 points of damage.

They live thousands of years, and as each dragon matures it develops traits that its sires may never have evinced. Draconic intelligence can in some cases greatly exceed human limits, and elder dragons are quite learned. Many dragons have a proclivity for magic, and as such learn to cast spells at or above human levels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most dragons are covetous, prideful, and solitary. They make their lair in caves, castles, monuments, and aeries, where they accumulate prized possessions. Even young dragons have voracious appetites, and older specimens are multi-ton predators. A dragon is always the alpha predator in its region, emerging from its redoubt periodically to feed and fly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Any dragon appearing in your game should be named. These creatures are so rare and special that mortals of a given region never refer to &ldquo;a dragon&rdquo;&mdash;it is always &ldquo;the dragon,&rdquo; always with a specific name, typically the only dragon to reside within 100 miles of that place. When one dragon enters the territory of another, there is always conflict. Only in the case of mated pairs do they ever cohabitate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some dragons serve greater purposes. A dragon may be allied with Law or Chaos, the Elder Ones, select demons, demi-human lords, or rarely, mortal kingdoms. Their solitary nature makes dragons unsuitable as leaders, but there are cases where they have inspired cults and worshipful alliances of their own.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Basic Traits:</strong> In game terms, each dragon is unique. Use the tables below to randomly determine a dragon or select as you consider appropriate. Roll once on each table (I through VIII) to build the dragon. The guidelines below give some additional information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Hit dice:</strong> Dragons use a d12 for their Hit Dice, with the number of Hit Dice determined on Table I.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Actions:</strong> A dragon automatically receives one d20 action die for every attack shown on table II. This action die can only be used for attacks. In addition, a dragon has one or more action dice for spells, as shown on table IV. Finally, a dragon also has a breath weapon, as determined on table III. Its age, as seen on table II, determines how many times it can use its breath weapon per day. Each use of a breath weapon requires one action die.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Attack modifier:</strong> A dragon&rsquo;s attack modifier equals its Hit Dice plus a die roll, as shown on table I. This roll is made once and applies to all of the dragon&rsquo;s attacks. It has one or more attacks as shown on table II.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Damage dice:</strong> A dragon will have one or more attacks, depending on its age, as shown on table II. The attacks do progressively more damage, as follows:</p>\n<p>&bull; Claw attacks do [[/roll 1d8]] damage</p>\n<p>&bull; Bite attacks do [[/roll 1d12]] damage</p>\n<p>&bull; Tail slaps do [[/roll 1d20]] damage</p>\n<p>&bull; Wing buffets do [[/roll 2d12]] damage</p>\n<p>&bull; A crush, where a dragon slams its entire body onto an</p>\n<p>opponent, does [[/roll 3d12]] damage</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Critical hits:</strong> Dragons have their own crit tables, as noted earlier. A dragon scores critical hits on a natural 20. Most</p>\n<p>dragons roll multiple action dice each round and tend to score a fair number of critical hits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Initiative:</strong> A dragon&rsquo;s initiative modifier is equal to its Hit Dice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Movement:</strong> A dragon&rsquo;s speed is shown on table I. A dragon flies at twice its speed. Select dragons may also be able to swim, dig, or climb at their normal speed or faster. Saving throws: A dragon&rsquo;s saves are all the same, each equal to its Hit Dice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-journals.TzprZwkin2mIPI37]{Dragon Table I: Dragon Size}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-journals.geDDs5OXDLdXQ5EQ]{Dragon Table II: Dragon Age}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-journals.5SPVoybpi3V1UHek]{Dragon Table III: Dragon Breath Weapon}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-journals.NkxmEzj4kr909FNy]{Dragon Table IV: Dragon Spell Use*}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-journals.6XkjOoHHmZnnlanS]{Dragon Table V: Dragon Martial Powers}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-journals.TuNWGrtsnmylQJiI]{Dragon Table VI: Dragon Unique Powers}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-journals.xUjBLMl22Ui7aZQi]{Dragon Table VII: Dragon Appearance}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-journals.KR8L6He5sJdrtbFt]{Dragon Table VIII: Dragon Alignment}</p>"}
