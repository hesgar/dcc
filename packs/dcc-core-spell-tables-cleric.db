This sanctum becomes a refuge for the cleric and other worshippers of the deity. The spell can also be cast upon a space already sacrosanct to another deity. If the cleric&rsquo;s spell check is greater than that of the cleric who originally sanctified the space, the area becomes desecrated and no longer grants any benefits to those within.

For example, a sanctuary dedicated to Klazath, god of war, would modify all combat rolls made by the cleric and his followers while within the sacred space. The devotees of Amun Tor, god of mysteries and riddles, would gain the sanctuary&rsquo;s bonus to rolls made to decipher codes or uncover hidden clues; while those of Bobugbubilz, demon lord of evil amphibians, would discover that all batrachian servants or summoned creatures within the sanctuary add the bonus to their hit points, saving throws, and attack rolls.</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Sanctify/Desecrate]{Sanctify/Desecrate}</p>","results":[{"_id":"vCXEuXWBd70pBRv5","flags":{},"type":0,"text":"Failure.","img":"icons/svg/d20-black.svg","resultId":"","weight":17,"range":[-99,17],"drawn":false},{"_id":"oR5wSQhiRAXQl4D9","flags":{},"type":0,"text":"The cleric creates a minor sanctuary.

For example, the cleric can change a sling stone into a spider, an arrow to an asp, or a staff into a serpent. The specifics are as follows:</p>\n<p>&bull; At low levels of effect (see below), the cleric can transform a small object into a poisonous spider. The object can be a coin, gem, sling stone, apple, beer mug, or other such small thing. The spell descriptions below assume a sling stone is used. For the spell&rsquo;s duration, the object retains its natural shape until it touches an enemy. So, for example, the cleric can hide a gemstone in a chest, which transforms into a spider when grasped; or launch an attack with his sling, and the stone transforms into a spider or scorpion when it strikes the enemy. Once the object touches an enemy (either through their grasp or via a successful hit as with a sling stone), it transforms into a spider, which remains for a certain amount of time. The spider receives one bite immediately on the round of attack and one additional bite each round until the spell ends. (A missed sling stone does not transform.) It reverts to its natural shape at the end of the spell. The poisonous spider is AC 14 (due to small size and agility) and has only 1 hp, but immediately scurries toward exposed flesh and strikes the enemy. On the first bite, the spider&rsquo;s attack automatically hits, causing damage 1 + poison. The target must make a Fort save against the spell check DC or suffer poison as per a (roll [[/roll 1d3]]) (1) black widow; (2) tarantula; or (3) scorpion (see Appendix P). On future rounds the spider must make an attack roll at Atk +2 in order to inflict damage. Note that the spider continues to scurry about and bite for the duration of the spell. Strikes against it that miss have a 50% chance of hitting the spell&rsquo;s target for damage.</p>\n<p>&bull;At medium levels of effect (see below), the cleric can transform an arrow into an asp or adder. (He could also transform other similarly shaped objects into an asp or adder: a stick of wood, a lever, a metal rod, etc.) As above, the object retains its natural shape until it touches an enemy, at which point it transforms. The asp or adder receives one bite immediately on the round of attack and one additional bite each round until the spell ends. The first bite automatically hits, causing damage 2 +</p>\n<p>poison. The target must make a Fort save against the spell check DC or suffer the poison of an asp or adder (see Appendix P). On future rounds the snake must make an attack roll at Atk +4 in order to inflict damage. Note that the snake continues to slither about and bite for the duration of the spell. Strikes against it that miss have a 50% chance of hitting the spell&rsquo;s target for damage.</p>\n<p>&bull; At the highest levels of effect (see below), the cleric can transform a staff into a cobra or viper. (He could also transform other similarly shaped objects into a cobra: a tree branch, a pole arm, etc.) In this case, each time the cleric strikes with the staff, it transforms into a serpent, bites, and then transforms back into a staff. The serpent-staff is treated as a +4 magical weapon, so it attacks at the cleric&rsquo;s normal attack bonus with an additional +4 modifier. Any successful attack causes normal weapon damage, +4 for the magical modifier, and inflicts poison as per a cobra or viper strike (see Appendix P). The Fort save against the poison is the spell check result. If the cleric strikes with the staff and then releases it, the staff remains in serpent form and continues to attack with its bite for the duration of the spell; in this case, it attacks at Atk +6 and inflicts damage of [[/roll 1d4+4]] plus poison.</p>\n<p>In all cases, the transformed spider or serpent is wild and uncontrolled. It will not obey commands from the cleric. An arrow that transforms into an asp, for example, cannot be commanded to return to the cleric after killing its target. It will simply slither off like any wild snake.</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Stinging Stone]{Stinging Stone}</p>","results":[{"_id":"HMB0iNmhvQzbFssF","flags":{},"type":0,"text":"Failure.","img":"icons/svg/d20-black.svg","resultId":"","weight":13,"range":[-99,13],"drawn":false},{"_id":"WyI4ZMZXZ0lptif0","flags":{},"type":0,"text":"The cleric can transform a single small object, up to the size of a sling stone, into a poisonous spider.
