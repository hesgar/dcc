The cleric binds that creature to obey his will instead of the will of its current master. A Will save is allowed to resist, but the Will save is made by the other spellcaster not the target creature, which is already dominated. If the check is successful, control of the bound creature transfers to the cleric casting binding. The cleric retains control for a time, after which control reverts back to the original caster (by which time the original summoning or controlling spell may have ended).

Cleric magic is the act of divine creatures, and wizard magic is frequently the result of deals, agreements, and arrangements with demons, devils, ghosts, and supernatural patrons. Using restore vitality to offset spellburn will inevitably create trouble for the cleric, whose deity surely does not appreciate his power being used to heal wounds deliberately created to further the ends of another supernatural creature!</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Restore Vitality]{Restore Vitality}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","summary":""},"source":"","config":{"inheritSpellCheck":true},"available":true,"level":2,"range":"Touch or further","duration":"Permanent","page":"278","castingTime":"1 turn","results":{"table":"Restore Vitality","collection":"dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-cleric"},"save":"N/A","spellCheck":{"die":"1d20","value":0},"mercurialEffect":{"value":null,"summary":"","description":""}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/stump-regrowth.svg","effects":[],"_id":"PzoF3PR65hF9BaDz"}
{"name":"Stinging Stone","permission":{"default":0,"U5X07uKi3FMVWkQ1":3},"type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The cleric transforms an object into a poisonous creature. For example, the cleric can change a sling stone into a spider, an arrow to an asp, or a staff into a serpent. The specifics are as follows:</p>\n<p>&bull; At low levels of effect (see below), the cleric can transform a small object into a poisonous spider. The object can be a coin, gem, sling stone, apple, beer mug, or other such small thing. The spell descriptions below assume a sling stone is used. For the spell&rsquo;s duration, the object retains its natural shape until it touches an enemy. So, for example, the cleric can hide a gemstone in a chest, which transforms into a spider when grasped; or launch an attack with his sling, and the stone transforms into a spider or scorpion when it strikes the enemy. Once the object touches an enemy (either through their grasp or via a successful hit as with a sling stone), it transforms into a spider, which remains for a certain amount of time. The spider receives one bite immediately on the round of attack and one additional bite each round until the spell ends. (A missed sling stone does not transform.) It reverts to its natural shape at the end of the spell. The poisonous spider is AC 14 (due to small size and agility) and has only 1 hp, but immediately scurries toward exposed flesh and strikes the enemy. On the first bite, the spider&rsquo;s attack automatically hits, causing damage 1 + poison. The target must make a Fort save against the spell check DC or suffer poison as per a (roll [[/roll 1d3]]) (1) black widow; (2) tarantula; or (3) scorpion (see Appendix P). On future rounds the spider must make an attack roll at Atk +2 in order to inflict damage. Note that the spider continues to scurry about and bite for the duration of the spell. Strikes against it that miss have a 50% chance of hitting the spell&rsquo;s target for damage.</p>\n<p>&bull;At medium levels of effect (see below), the cleric can transform an arrow into an asp or adder. (He could also transform other similarly shaped objects into an asp or adder: a stick of wood, a lever, a metal rod, etc.) As above, the object retains its natural shape until it touches an enemy, at which point it transforms. The asp or adder receives one bite immediately on the round of attack and one additional bite each round until the spell ends. The first bite automatically hits, causing damage 2 +</p>\n<p>poison. The target must make a Fort save against the spell check DC or suffer the poison of an asp or adder (see Appendix P). On future rounds the snake must make an attack roll at Atk +4 in order to inflict damage. Note that the snake continues to slither about and bite for the duration of the spell. Strikes against it that miss have a 50% chance of hitting the spell&rsquo;s target for damage.</p>\n<p>&bull; At the highest levels of effect (see below), the cleric can transform a staff into a cobra or viper. (He could also transform other similarly shaped objects into a cobra: a tree branch, a pole arm, etc.) In this case, each time the cleric strikes with the staff, it transforms into a serpent, bites, and then transforms back into a staff. The serpent-staff is treated as a +4 magical weapon, so it attacks at the cleric&rsquo;s normal attack bonus with an additional +4 modifier. Any successful attack causes normal weapon damage, +4 for the magical modifier, and inflicts poison as per a cobra or viper strike (see Appendix P). The Fort save against the poison is the spell check result. If the cleric strikes with the staff and then releases it, the staff remains in serpent form and continues to attack with its bite for the duration of the spell; in this case, it attacks at Atk +6 and inflicts damage of [[/roll 1d4+4]] plus poison.</p>\n<p>In all cases, the transformed spider or serpent is wild and uncontrolled. It will not obey commands from the cleric. An arrow that transforms into an asp, for example, cannot be commanded to return to the cleric after killing its target. It will simply slither off like any wild snake.</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Stinging Stone]{Stinging Stone}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","summary":""},"source":"","config":{"inheritSpellCheck":true},"available":true,"level":2,"range":"Objects touched","duration":"See below","page":"282","castingTime":"1 turn","results":{"table":"Stinging Stone","collection":"dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-cleric"},"save":"Fort vs. spell check DC","spellCheck":{"die":"1d20","value":0},"mercurialEffect":{"value":null,"summary":"","description":""}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/hydra-shot.svg","effects":[],"_id":"RbNAcAAQRtdsyOEZ"}
