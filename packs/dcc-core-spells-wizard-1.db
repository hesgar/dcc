{"_id":"sg5mbVXiP9j4Z3fX","name":"Patron Bond (Self)","permission":{"default":0,"wWErSsSXezizF0nw":3},"type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The caster commits himself to the service of a supernatural lord, forming a pact to gain its support as his patron so long as he continues to please it with his service. This patron may be a demon, devil, ghost, spirit, elemental, angel, chaos lord, or other supernatural being who accepts the caster&rsquo;s service. The</p>\n<p>initial ceremony takes one week to complete. Once the pact is made, the caster may invoke the patron&rsquo;s support with the spell invoke patron, and it may or may not answer as it sees fit. In return for the patron&rsquo;s assistance, it may ask the caster to do certain things. The caster must act faithfully in its service at all times, lest it cast him off. The caster may perform more than one ceremony to serve multiple masters, but doing so may raise questions as to his true loyalties. This is dangerous magic; a supernatural patron is not the same as the deity that a cleric may worship. The caster should be forewarned that he is in communion with almighty spirits.</p>\n<p>Alternately, once the caster has formed a bond with his patron, this spell may be cast to create a bond between another mortal and the caster&rsquo;s patron. The mortal need not be a spellcaster; in fact, the second mortal usually is not. In this case, both the caster and the recipient must spend a week on the ceremony, which requires a mighty oath to declare allegiance to the patron. Very powerful creatures are more likely to successfully bond with patrons (who look more favorably upon powerful followers). Typically, a casting of patron bond on behalf of another receives a bonus of +2 if the subject is of 5th-level (5 HD) or higher and +4 if the subject is of 9th-level (9 HD) or higher. At the end of the ceremony, the casting of the spell seals the bond. Recruiting additional followers for his patron brings the caster favor and may grant boons to the other followers; though, their patron will ask fealty of them in exchange.</p>\n<p>Note that continued casting of this spell may taint the caster, both spiritually and physically.</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Patron Bond (Self)]{Patron Bond (Self)}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","summary":""},"source":"","config":{"inheritActionDie":true,"inheritSpellCheck":true,"castingMode":"wizard"},"available":true,"level":1,"range":"Self or touch","duration":"Lifetime","page":"148","castingTime":"1 week + quests","results":{"table":"Patron Bond (Self)","collection":"dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-wizard"},"save":"None","spellCheck":{"die":"1d20","value":0},"mercurialEffect":{"value":null,"summary":"","description":""}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/linked-rings.svg","effects":[]}
